But as opportunities for innovation and growth migrate to the peripheries of companies, industries, and the global economy, efficiency will no longer be enough to sustain competitive advantage.<br />In Your Next Business Strategy, renowned business thinkers John Hagel and John Seely Brown argue that the only sustainable advantage in the future will come from an institutional capacity to work closely with other highly specialized firms to get better faster. Enabled by the emergence of global process networks, firms will undergo a three-stage transformation: deepening specialization within firms; mobilizing best-in-class capabilities across enterprises; and, ultimately, accelerating learning across broad networks of enterprises.<br /><br />Hagel and Seely Brown discuss the strategic levers that will accelerate this migration, and they outline a new approach to strategy development that will help companies capture this shifting source of strategic advantage.<br /><br />Calling for a forceful reinvention of business strategy and the very nature of the firm itself, this bold and forward-looking book reveals what every company must do today to become tomorrow’s market leader.<br /></p>",

With his own fortune estimated at between $400 million and $900 million, he doesn\'t have to be. Instead, Dennis wants to demystify the money-getting process, and his straight-talking, honest advice makes a refreshing change in this oversaturated field. Using humorous examples from his own business life, Dennis\'s advice, from The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors to The Power of Focus, might sound like conventional fare, but delivered in his signature bawdy, British style, it\'s altogether more entertaining—and more practical. Dennis highlights the right strategies and mindset to get readers their millions, but he won\'t air-brush his story or soften the bitter truth along the way.

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>Unabashedly inspired by Malcolm Gladwell\'s bestselling The Tipping Point, the brothers Heath—Chip a professor at Stanford\'s business school, Dan a teacher and textbook publisher—offer an entertaining, practical guide to effective communication. Drawing extensively on psychosocial studies on memory, emotion and motivation, their study is couched in terms of \"stickiness\"—that is, the art of making ideas unforgettable. They start by relating the gruesome urban legend about a man who succumbs to a barroom flirtation only to wake up in a tub of ice, victim of an organ-harvesting ring. What makes such stories memorable and ensures their spread around the globe? The authors credit six key principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. (The initial letters spell out \"success\"—well, almost.) They illustrate these principles with a host of stories, some familiar (Kennedy\'s stirring call to \"land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth\" within a decade) and others very funny (Nora Ephron\'s anecdote of how her high school journalism teacher used a simple, embarrassing trick to teach her how not to \"bury the lead\"). Throughout the book, sidebars show how bland messages can be made intriguing. Fun to read and solidly researched, this book deserves a wide readership.</p>",

That\'s where the future lies, and that\'s what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today\'s web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don\'t work like the Web, and they\'re missing out on its advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book puts the \"Web\" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language\r\n<li>Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services</li>\r\n<li>Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</li>\r\n<li>Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon\'s Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol</li>\r\n<li>Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages</li>\r\n<li>Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python)</li>\r\n<li>Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients</li>\r\n<li>This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Written in a frank but engaging style, Debugging provides simple, foolproof principles guaranteed to help find any bug quickly. This book makes those shelves of application-specific debugging books (on C++, Perl, Java, etc.) obsolete. It changes the way readers think about debugging, making those pesky problems suddenly much easier to find and fix. Illustrating the rules with real-life bug-detection war stories, the book shows readers how to: * Understand the system: how perceiving the \"\"roadmap\"\" can hasten your journey * Quit thinking and look: when hands-on investigation can\'t be avoided * Isolate critical factors: why changing one element at a time can be an essential tool * Keep an audit trail: how keeping a record of the debugging process can win the day\"",

They can draw up business plans, have meetings with venture capitalists, maybe even get funded and actually launch a start-up. However, in The Monk and the Riddle, Silicon Valley sage Randy Komisar reasons that\'s only half the equation for success. And it may not be the important half. Komisar has worked with a number of companies--Apple, LucasArts Entertainment (the gaming division of George Lucas\'s empire), and WebTV among them--and has come to a rather startling conclusion: if you can\'t see yourself doing this business for the rest of your life, don\'t start it. In other words, he wants to see passion and purpose in business, not just spreadsheets and a by-the-numbers business model.</p>\r\n<p>To illustrate, Komisar takes the reader through a hypothetical Silicon Valley start-up, with an eager entrepreneur named Lenny trying to get funding for an online casket-selling business. As Komisar helps Lenny find the real purpose of the business, the passion behind the revenue projections, he reflects back on his life as an entrepreneur. Komisar emerges as a master storyteller, the kind of guy you\'d feel honored to share a bottle of wine with. And you believe his conclusion: \"When all is said and done, the journey is the reward.\" It\'s great if you\'ve made billions on the journey, but the important thing is that you do something you can truly throw yourself into</p>",

The premise behind this book is that in order for marketing strategies to work, they must be in tune with some quintessential force in the marketplace. Just as the laws of physics define the workings of the universe, so do successful marketing programs conform to the \"22 Laws.\" Each law is presented with illustrations of how it works based on actual companies and their marketing strategies. For example, the \"Law of Focus\" states that the most powerful concept in marketing is \"owning\" a word in the prospect\'s mind, such as Crest\'s owning cavities and Nordstrom\'s owning service. The book is fun to read, contains solid information, and should be acquired by all public and business school libraries. It will be requested by readers of the authors\' earlier titles.</p>",

No matter: Clark is as successful and interesting an example of Homo siliconus as any writer is likely to find. Lewis (Liar\'s Poker) has created an absorbing and extremely literate profile of one of America\'s most successful entrepreneurs. Clark has created three companiesASilicon Graphics, Netscape (now part of America Online) and HealtheonAeach valued at more than $1 billion by Wall Street. Lewis was apparently given unlimited access to Clark, a man motivated in equal parts by a love of the technology he helps to create and a desire to prove something to a long list of people whom he believes have done him wrong throughout his life (especially his former colleagues at Silicon Graphics). As Lewis looks at the various roles of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and programmers and at how these very different mindsets fit together in the anatomy of big deals, he gives readers a sense of how the Valley works. But the heart of the book remains Clark, who simultaneously does everything from supervise the creation of what may be the world\'s largest sloop to creating his fourth company (currently in the works). Lewis does a good job of putting Clark\'s accomplishments in context, and if he is too respectful of Clark\'s privacy (several marriages and children are mentioned but not elaborated on), he provides a detailed look at the professional life of one of the men who have changed the world as we know it.</p>",

He then gives the site a make-over using XHTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), so you can see how to replace bloated code with lean markup and CSS for fast-loading sites that are accessible to all users. Finally, he covers several popular fluid and elastic-width layout techniques and pieces together all of the page components discussed in prior chapters into a single-page template. </p>",

It\'s the first concept to deal with the problems of communicating in an overcommunicated society. With this approach, a company creates a \'position\' in the prospect\'s mind, one that reflects the company\'s own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of its competitors. Witty and fast-paced, this book spells out how to position a leader so that it gets into the mind and stays there, position a follower in a way that finds a \'hole\' not occupied by the leader, and avoid the pitfalls of letting a second product ride on the coattails of an established one. Revised to reflect significant developments in the five years since its original publication, Positioning reveals the fascinating case histories and anecdotes behind the campaigns of many stunning successes and failures in the world of advertising.</p>",

John Nesheim, an adjunct professor at Cornell\'s Johnson Graduate School of Management, who has personally structured over $300 million in new-venture deals, lays out the step-by-step skinny in High Tech Startup. Incorporating some two dozen case studies spanning the technology spectrum, he presents info specific to this industry that will help you get from concept to IPO. It begins with a 14-phase schedule itemizing time requirements, necessary assistance, typical participants, major costs, main risks, and desired results for each step. It then details all the critical stages (i.e., forming the company, preparing the business plan, assembling the team, dealing with venture capitalists and other funding sources). Nesheim focuses on practical strategies that should certainly improve your chances, but don\'t start prepping for that on-air interview with Mark Haines just yet: Only six out of 1 million high-tech ideas, he notes, ever become successful companies that go public</p>",

How to Win Friends and Influence People is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to \"the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people.\" He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person\'s point of view and \"arousing in the other person an eager want.\" You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, \"let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers,\" and \"talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\" Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. </p>",

They\'re looking for the next Amazon.com, the next Yahoo!, the next eBay. Randall E. Stross, who teaches business history at San José State University, just happened to be there when a firm called Benchmark Capital discovered eBay. eBoys tells the story of how a group of not-quite-middle-aged men came to make an investment that returned a Silicon Valley record of 100,000 percent.</p>\r\n<p>Stross is a gifted storyteller who weaves the personal histories of the Benchmark partners with stories of how the firm came to back such companies as Priceline.com and Webvan. We meet guys who weren\'t born to privilege, men who took unconventional routes into the venture capital business. Probably the most intriguing is Dave Beirne, a hyperaggressive executive recruiter who went into the business after realizing venture capitalists are the ones who really call the shots at high-tech start-ups. We also see the problems Silicon Valley guys have when they try to dot-com the bricks-and-mortar world. The short tale of an aborted partnership between Benchmark and Toys \'R\' Us illustrates why the old economy is so mystified by the new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone interested in how business works should find something of interest in eBoys.

Porter\'s Competitive Strategy has transformed the theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world. Electrifying in its simplicity -- like all great breakthroughs -- Porter\'s analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus -- which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter\'s framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new discipline of competitor assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than a million managers in both large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter\'s ideas and applied them to assess industries, understand competitors,, and choose competitive positions. The ideas in the book address the underlying fundamentals of competition in a way that is independent of the specifics of the ways companies go about competing.</p>\r\n\r\nCompetitive Strategy has filled a void in management thinking. It provides an enduring foundation and grounding point on which all subsequent work can be built. By bringing a disciplined structure to the question of how firms achieve superior profitability, Porter\'s rich frameworks and deep insights comprise a sophisticated view of competition unsurpassed in the last quarter-century.",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>Having the big idea is merely the beginning. Raising and using venture capital is pivotal to the success of many an ambitious new venture, but venture capital is more than money. It\'s far too expensive to be treated merely as cash, and if used well, far more critical to the successful venture. This can be a daunting process. This text leads you inside the world of European venture capital, and takes you step-by-step through the venture cycle. By holding a mirror up to both sides of the money-raising process, This text shows how entrepreneurs can better understand venture capitalists - and vice versa - leading to more productive relationships and smarter ventures. Katharine Campbell explains how venture capitalists think, what they are looking for and why. Learn how to spot the good -and the bad - investors, and equip yourself with the tools and the knowledge to seal a successful partnership. Smarter Ventures is the bible of the European venture capital market and your complete companion to the venture cycle. Showing how to develop and build a successful new venture pitch, this text deals with everything from the structure of venture capital firms and its influence on their objectives down to how to dress for the initial meeting with the potential investor.</p>",

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, and substantial additions to the chapter on recurrences (now called \"Divide-and-Conquer\"). It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks.

You\'ll learn by pragmatic example how to create effective designs composed of interfaces to objects, components and services. You\'ll see techniques for breaking down solutions into interfaces and then determining appropriate implementation of those interfaces to create a well structured, robust, working program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interface Oriented Design explores how to develop robust, reliable software as a collection of interfaces that interact with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You\'ll learn what polymorphism and encapsulation really mean, and how to use these ideas more effectively. See how to create better interfaces using agile development techniques, and learn the subtle differences between implementing an interface and inheriting an implementation. Take a fresh, modern view of Design By Contract and class responsibilities. Understand the basis of a service-oriented architecture, including stateful versus stateless interfaces, procedural versus document models, and synchronous versus asynchronous invocations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn about the most useful patterns, including Proxy, Facade, Adapter, and Factory, as well categories of interfaces including service providers, information holders, and external world interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to be a more effective programmer and create better software, you need Interface Oriented Design.</p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>The compiler is the linchpin of the programmer\'s toolbox. Working programmers use compilers every day and count heavily on their correctness and reliability. A compiler must accept the standard definition of the programming language so that source code will be portable across platforms. A compiler must generate efficient object code. Perhaps more important, a compiler must generate correct object code; an application is only as reliable as the compiler that compiled it.<br/>\r\n\r\nA compiler is itself a large and complex application that is worthy of study in its own right. This book tours most of the implementation of lcc, a compiler for the ANSI C programming language. It is to compiling what Software Tools by B.W. Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (Addison-Wesley, 1976) is to text processing like text editors and macro processors. Software design and implementation are best learned through experience with real tools. This book explains in detail and shows most of the code for a real compiler. The accompanying diskette holds the source code for the complete compiler.<br/>\r\n\r\nlcc is a production compiler. It\'s been used to compile production programs since 1988 and is now used by hundreds of C programmers daily. Detailing most of a production compiler in a book leaves little room for supporting material, so we present only the theory needed for the implementation at hand and leave the broad survey of compiling techniques to existing texts. The book omits a few language features--those with mundane or repetitive implementations and those deliberately treated only in the exercises--but the full compiler is available on the diskette, and the book makes it understandable.<br/>\r\n\r\nThe obvious use for this book is to learn more about compiler construction. But only few programmers need to know how to design and implement compilers. Most work on applications and other aspects of systems programming. There are four reasons why this majority of C programmers may benefit from this book.<br/>\r\n\r\nFirst, programmers who understand how a C compiler works are often better programmers in general and better C programmers in particular. The compiler writer must understand even the darkest corners of the C language; touring the implementation of those corners reveals much about the language itself and its efficient realization on modern computers.<br/>\r\n\r\nSecond, most texts on programming must necessarily use small examples, which often demonstrate techniques simply and elegantly. Most programmers, however, work on large programs that have evolved--or degenerated--over time. There are few well documented examples of this kind of \"programming in the large\" that can serve as reference examples. lcc isn\'t perfect, but this book documents both its good and bad points in detail and thus provides one such reference point.<br/>\r\n\r\nThird, a compiler is one of the best demonstrations in computer science of the interaction between theory and practice. lcc displays both the places where this interaction is smooth and the results are elegant, as well as where practical demands strain the theory, which shows in the resulting code. Exploring these interactions in a real program helps programmers understand when, where, and how to apply different techniques. lcc also illustrates numerous C programming techniques.<br/>\r\n\r\nFourth, this book is an example of a \"literate program.\" Like TEX: The Program by D.E. Knuth (Addison-Wesley, 1986), this book is lcc\'s source code and the prose that describes it. The code is presented in the order that best suits understanding, not in the order dictated by the C programming language. The source code that appears on the diskette is extracted automatically from the book\'s text files.<br/>\r\n\r\nThis book is well suited for self-study by both academics and professionals. The book and its diskette offer complete documented source code for lcc, so they may interest practitioners who wish to experiment with compilation or those working in application areas that use or implement language-based tools and techniques, such as user interfaces.<br/>\r\n\r\nThe book shows a large software system, warts and all. It could thus be the subject of a postmortem in a software engineering course, for example.<br/>\r\n\r\nFor compiler courses, this book complements traditional compiler texts. It shows one way of implementing a C compiler, while traditional texts survey algorithms for solving the broad range of problems encountered in compiling. Limited space prevents such texts from including more than a toy compiler. Code generation is often treated at a particularly high level to avoid tying the book to a specific computer.<br/>\r\n\r\nAs a result many instructors prepare a substantial programming project to give their students some practical experience. These instructors usually must write these compilers from scratch; students duplicate large portions and have to use the rest with only limited documentation. The situation is trying for both students and instructors, and unsatisfying to boot, because the compilers are still toys. By documenting most of a real compiler and providing the source code, this book offers an alternative.<br/>\r\n\r\nThis book presents full code generators for the MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Intel 386 and successor architectures. It exploits recent research that produces code generators from compact specifications. These methods allow us to present complete code generators for several machines, which no other book does. Presenting several code generators avoids tying the book to a single machine, and helps students appreciate engineering retargetable software.<br/>\r\n\r\nAssignments can add language features, optimizations, and targets. When used with a traditional survey text, assignments could also replace existing modules with those using alternate algorithms. Such assignments come closer to the actual practice of compiler engineering than assignments that implement most of a toy compiler, where too much time goes to low-level infrastructure and accommodating repetitive language features. Many of the exercises pose just these kinds of engineering problems.<br/>\r\n\r\nlcc has also been adapted for purposes other than conventional compilation. For example, it\'s been used for building a C browser and for generating remote-procedure-call stubs from declarations. It could also be used to experiment with language extensions, proposed computer architectures and code-generator technologies.<br/>\r\n\r\nWe assume readers are fluent in C and assembly language for some computer, know what a compiler is and have a general understanding of what one does, and have a working understanding of data structures and algorithms at the level covered in typical undergraduate courses; the material covered by Algorithms in C by R. Sedgewick (Addison-Wesley, 1990), for example, is more than sufficient for understanding lcc.</p>",

In addition, more advanced chapters are now included so that it can be used as the basis for a two-semester or graduate course. The most accepted and successful techniques are described in a concise way, rather than as an exhaustive catalog of every possible variant. Detailed descriptions of the interfaces between modules of a compiler are illustrated with actual C header files. The first part of the book, Fundamentals of Compilation, is suitable for a one-semester first course in compiler design. The second part, Advanced Topics, which includes the advanced chapters, covers the compilation of object-oriented and functional languages, garbage collection, loop optimizations, SSA form, loop scheduling, and optimization for cache-memory hierarchies.",

Clearly organized and filled with a wide-ranging perspective on over 40 different languages, this book will be appreciated for its depth and breadth of coverage on an essential topic in computer science.<br/>\r\n\r\nWith references to dozens of programming languages, from Ada to Turing and everything in between (including C, C++, Java, and Perl), this book is a truly in-depth guide to how code is compiled (or interpreted) and executed on computer hardware. Early chapters tend to be slightly more theoretical (with coverage of regular expressions and context-free grammars) and will be most valuable to the computer science student, but much of this book is accessible to anyone seeking to widen their knowledge (especially since recent standards surrounding XML make use of some of the same vocabulary presented here).<br/>\r\n\r\nThe book has a comprehensive discussion of compilation and linking, as well as how data types are implemented in memory. Sections on functional and logical programming (illustrated with Scheme and Prolog, which are often used in AI research) can expand your understanding of how programming languages work. Final sections on the advantages--and complexities--of concurrent processing, plus a nice treatment of code optimization techniques, round out the text here. Each chapter provides numerous exercises, so you can try out the ideas on your own.<br/>\r\n\r\nStudents will benefit from the practical examples here, drawn from a wide range of languages. If you are a self-taught developer, the very approachable tutorial can give you perspective on the formal definitions of many computer languages, which can help you master new ones more effectively</p>",

Denotational semantics is then naturally introduced. The second part focuses more on implementation techniques and discusses precompilation for fast interpretation: threaded code or bytecode; compilation towards C. Some extensions are also described such as dynamic evaluation, reflection, macros and objects. This will become the new standard reference for people wanting to know more about the Lisp family of languages: how they work, how they are implemented, what their variants are and why such variants exist. The full code is supplied (and also available over the Net). A large bibliography is given as well as a considerable number of exercises.

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>The first edition of Programming Pearls was one of the most influential books I read early in my career, and many of the insights I first encountered in that book stayed with me long after I read it. Jon has done a wonderful job of updating the material. I am very impressed at how fresh the new examples seem.\" -Steve McConnell\r\nWhen programmers list their favorite books, Jon Bentley\'s collection of programming pearls is commonly included among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley\'s pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on * testing, debugging, and timing * set representations * string problems All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What remains the same in this new edition is Bentley\'s focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems. Whether you are new to Bentley\'s classic or are revisiting his work for some fresh insight, the book is sure to make your own list of favorites.</p>",

            "BookReviewHtml":"<h2><strong>the review</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Some jokester once said \"If they\'d only listened to me\" should be the subtitle \n    for most every book coming out of Washington.\n</p>\n<p>\n    His point was: there are only so many kinds of books in the world. And whether \n    you\'re a lover of politics, sports, history, technology, or startups, the books \n    you read are all going to fall into a small number of predefined categories.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I was thinking about those categories when I read \"The Four Steps to the \n    Epiphany\" by Steven Gary Blank. Was this going to be a \"You can do it too!\" \n    book, high on emotional content and narrative and short on details? Or is it \n    going to be a \"My Theory of Everything\" book, where the author tells us in \n    detail how the entire universe works? Or will it be that \n    old standby of tech books, the encyclopedia -- you know, where the book runs \n    on past 1500 pages and just keeps going and going?\n<p>\n<p>\n    Turns out it was a small part \"You can do it too!\" but mostly a \"My Theory \n    of Everything\" book, with a bit of encyclopedia thrown in for good measure.\n</P>\n<p>\n    I have to admit I have a real love-hate relationship with \"The Four Steps to the Epiphany\". \n    It sat on my bookshelf for two years waiting for me to read it. Truth be told, \n    I made a couple of half-hearted but couldn\'t make it past the first chapter or two. It\'s a truly \n    great book, but it sucked. I just couldn\'t grok it. I kept reading posts on Hacker News about how good \n    the book was, but I resisted picking it back up. It just sat there on the shelf, staring at me \n    accusingly. \n    Finally, <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1931467\">\n    in a strange post that I still don\'t understand, yummyfajitas just posted the \n    title of the book and all the great reviews it had on Amazon.</a> Why the heck did he do \n    that? Beats me, but frack, a hint is a hint. I\'d better get busy, dig in, and finally finish it.\n</p>\n<p>\n    And man, what great reviews it got. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/hgnZNW\">If you look over on Amazon, it got 73 reviews -- \n    70 of which were 4 stars or better. Folks loved it.</a> It\'s \"The Bible\", \n    \"A must read for every startup,\" \"This book is like a gun\" says one guy. \n    \"The most important business book I\'ve ever read,\" says another.\n</p>\n<p>\n    geesh\n</p>\n<p>\n    Enough already! I\'ll read the damn book!\n</p>\n<p>\n    So why do I hate reading it so much?\n</p>\n<p>\n    First, I don\'t want to sound picky, but this is the worst job I have ever seen of \n    editing and typesetting a book in my entire life. There were numerous misspellings -- things any \n    spell-checker would have caught. Chapter 4 started and went to a conclusion, all \n    the while the caption at the bottom of the page said we were still on chapter 3. \n    The \"chapter 4\" caption only appeared once, at the bottom of a blank page.\n    Chapters and sections had a topic, but no narrative (and little voice). It was \n    a painful thing to experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Blank crosses the line from instructive text to descriptive text many, many, \n    many times. Instructive text tells you how to build watches. Descriptive text \n    explains for you the 40 thousand types of watches and how they differ from each \n    other. The book is full of tables. Table after table. I got lost in the tables after a while. \n    They just all sort of blended together. I think I had dreams about tables.\n</p>\n<p>\n    But in fairness, this book has a wide purview. It attempts to cover the entire universe of startups, \n    from initial idea to ongoing concern. That\'s a pretty big thing to do, and what \n    happens is that the author has to do a lot of data dumps in order to cover all \n    of the bases. One of the critical things I learned was market identification: how \n    to do it and what it means. There are four types of markets, and depending on which \n    one you are in, you need to do different things.\n</p>\n<p>\n    But geesh, my startup is only in <strong>one</strong> type of market, and Blank goes \n    on and on in each chapter about my market -- but also the other three. That means there is \n    four times as much information in the book as I need in my particular case. Like a good solider I \n    trudged on through all the other markets, all the time wondering if I would <strong>ever</strong> use this \n    information some day and wondering if I should be spending time worrying about what to \n    be doing in my second year of a startup if I\'m not even out of the gate yet.\n</p>\n<p>\n    And that\'s my critical beef with the book: it tries to do too much. This is really 7 or \n    8 short books condensed down into one dense book with lots of opinions, data, and \n    instructions. If anything, this book convinced me that the extended essay is the best \n    way to help people learn startups: it forces the author to focus on one audience, one topic, and one critical \n    message. In this book we get a little of everything. It was almost like trying to read the phone \n    book to learn how to operate a telephone.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Now that I\'ve trashed Blank, let me sing his praises. This is truly a one-of-a-kind \n    book and it is invaluable for anybody seriously considering a startup. I\'m not an \n    expert in startups -- hell, the reason I\'m reading these books is that I have a lot \n    to learn -- but I can tell from reading this that Steven has been around the block a \n    few times. He got the war stories, and the scars, to earn my respect, and from what he\'s \n    relating I can tell that he\'s seen many success and failures. He\'s somebody \n    I need to listen to.\n</p>\n<p>\n    And he <em>does</em> cover the bases. Heck, you\'ve basically got a bulleted list of stuff to do \n    for your entire startup. Who could ask for more? If I had to re-title the book, it \n    would be \"Steven\'s boring book for startups that you\'d be an idiot not to read\"\n</p>\n<p>\n    Not exactly catchy, but you get the drift.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One of the things I love most about these theory of everything books is that you \n    can tell what kinds of influence the author has had by watching the types of \n    analogies and metaphors he uses. Blank pulls in one of my favorites, OODA, early \n    on in the book. Then he introduces me to the New Lanchester Strategy, which alone \n    was worth the cost of the book (as he adroitly points out). We go over the fact \n    that an infinite amount of marketing money isn\'t going to make a dent if you\'re in \n    a new market (also easily worth the cost of the book), and he wisely separates each \n    small step that\'s required in the beginning, reminding us to take this one bit at a \n    time. At a couple of points in the process, he points out that you\'re meeting the customer, but \n    you\'re not selling anything yet! Listen first, theorize, verify, align -- many \n    steps are required before sales mode. Very non-intuitive if you haven\'t been there, \n    but terrifically great advice. The book was full of little insights like that.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One of the more interesting things I picked up on is the great amount of similarity \n    between agile and startups. As a coach, I\'ve seen dozens, maybe hundreds of teams \n    both succeed and fail. And one of the weirdest lessons I took away was that the \n    pattern was: there are no patterns. Or put differently: the number one mistake I \n    see is people using things they learned on the last project inappropriately on the \n    current project. Every project is unique, and you have to come in with an open mind \n    and be willing to change and adapt to make it work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It looks to me like much of startup work is the same. Folks come in with ideas that worked on previous \n    startups, or ideas that work everywhere else -- but don\'t work in that particular \n    situation. Big company types come in with big plans for marketing and branding, only \n    to find that they have a hammer when they really need a toothbrush. Teams run off and build \n    huge feature lists for problems that may never exist. People easily jump to conclusions \n    and make assumptions that hurt them severely later on. To me, this was the critical insight \n    that was alone worth the price of the book.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I see this book as a resource, much like a programming book. Scan it thoroughly when \n    you get it, try to absorb what you can but don\'t sweat it if you miss some of the details, \n    then pull out the pieces you need and work them as you reach the  \n    appropriate stage. Taken bit-by-bit like this, I think -- and I know this sounds like \n    hyperbole -- it\'s the best book on the <em>mechanics</em> of startups that I\'ve ever read. \n    Along those lines, as a companion book, I highly recommend Mahan Khalsa\'s book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/gTby4D\">\"Let\'s get real \n    (or let\'s not play)\"</a> which is much lighter and easier to digest, but also helps\n    you get the <em>attitude</em> to go about those difficult early days of meeting customers and \n    trying to figure out what you\'re doing. In fact I\'d say it was almost required \n    reading (or listening) after going through Blank\'s book. Blank has the details, \n    but Khalsa has the attitude. In my book, both are equally important.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the end, I\'m glad I read \"The Four Steps to the Epiphany\", but it was a long haul. If Blank would\'ve \n    gotten a good editor it could have been much easier. Who knows how many people, just like \n    me, will never read it, simply because of it\'s structural problems? Knowing what kind of book you have, \n    knowing what kind of startup you have, knowing what kind of market you have, all critical factors for \n    success. And ironically enough, that\'s \n    just the type of thing that Four Steps is good at helping other people understand.\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br/>Daniel is a life-long hacker and founder of HN-Books.

Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods is one example. Richard Feynman’s “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!” is another.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Now comes Youngme Moon’s Different, a book for “people who don’t read business books.” Actually, it’s more like a personal conversation with a friend who has thought deeply about how the world works … and who gets you to see that world in a completely new light. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>If there is one strain of conventional wisdom pervading every company in every industry, it’s the absolute importance of “competing like crazy.” Youngme Moon’s message is simply “Get off this treadmill that’s taking you nowhere. Going tit for tat and adding features, augmentations, and gimmicks to beat the competition has the perverse result of making you like everyone else.” Different provides a highly original perspective on what it means to offer something that is meaningfully different—different in a manner that is both fundamental and comprehensive. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Youngme Moon identifies the outliers, the mavericks, the iconoclasts—the players who have thoughtfully rejected orthodoxy in favor of an approach that is more adventurous. Some are even “hostile,” almost daring you to buy what they are selling. The MINI Cooper was launched with fearless abandon: “Worried that this car is too small? Look here. It’s even smaller than you think.” </p>\r\n \r\n<p>These are players that strike a genuine chord with even the most jaded consumers. In fact, almost every success story of the past two decades has been an exception to the rule. Simply go to your computer and compare AOL and Yahoo! with Google.

He knows what he\'s talking about; he is his own best example of success. In the early 1970s, while he was still in his twenties, he founded Erewhon, the largest distributor of natural foods.

Rails makes it both fun and easy to turn out very cool web applications. Need Ajax support, so your web applications are highly interactive? Rails has it built in. Want an application that sends and receives e-mail? Built in. Supports internationalization and localization? Built in. Do you need applications with a REST-based interface (so they can interact with other RESTful applications with almost no effort on your part)? All built-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this book, you\'ll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. Need to create and modify your schema? Migrations make it painless (and they\'re versioned, so you can roll changes backward and forward). You\'ll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There is extensive coverage of testing, and the rewritten Deployment chapter now covers Phusion Passenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with the previous editions of the book, we start with an extended tutorial that builds parts of an online store.

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls \"an intellectual Wild West.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.</p>",

            "BookReviewHtml":"<h2>the review</h2>\n\n<p>\"He\'s one of us\" is probably the highest compliment you can pay to an author \nthat\'s trying to help a community. And I\'m happy to pay that compliment to Rob \nWalling. Rob has put together an excellent book on how to transition from hacker \nto entrepreneur.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve read a lot of hacker and startup books over the years. Some, like the SEO book \nI recently reviewed, got pretty boring at times. Many times we tech people have a tendency \nto make everything we write into technical manuals. So I\'ve developed a nifty system of \nestimating the boring-ness of a book: if I\'m constantly watching my Kindle\'s \"percent \ncomplete\" at the bottom of the page, I\'m having a difficult time staying with the \nauthor.</p>\n\n<p>With \"Start Small, Stay Small\" I hardly ever looked at that percent complete number. \nThe book read so easily and well that I had to make myself stop reading it -- \nI was enjoying it as much (probably more, really) than the sci-fi book I was also \nreading at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because the book is targeted directly to me, the guy who knows how to code, maybe \nhas done a little consulting, but is now ready to move on to running his own startup. \nI don\'t need lessons in HTML, I don\'t need discusisons of yet another way to pull \ndata from a database, I can figure out how payment systems and app deployment will \nwork, I\'m not going to be the next Google \n -- I need practical advice on what to do right now. To get started. </p>\n\n\n<p>That makes it a \"beer\" book for me. \"Beer\" books are books where it\'s as if you are \nsitting down with the author over a beer to discuss what you\'re doing. The more \nconversational the tone, the more practical the advice, and the more the author can\n anticipate your replies, the better the beer book.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve read a few beer books over the years, and I\'ve found that the authors are \nnecessarily limited by their own experiences. If you read a book by a guy who sat \non the board of BigCorp X, Y, and Z, and saw the soaring success of company A and \nthe dismal flameout of company B, you\'re going to get stories about that. Nothing \nwrong with that, but with hacker/startup books in general, that means there is a \nhigh degree of selection bias involved: Whatever the author did or didn\'t do, they \nkind of make the book theme around that. If you\'re lucky, your experiences \nmatch up to the author\'s. If not, well, then you try to do the best you can by \nfilling in the blanks on your own.</p>\n\n<p>Rob kept telling me what I was thinking and then arguing against it. In one spot \nhe was telling me to outsource more \"I know you\'re probably not going to do it, but \nyou should at least consider it\"</p>\n\n<p>That shows me somebody who has had these conversations before and is anticipating \nmy stubborness. Awesome! And there were several examples like that. He would suggest \nsomething, I would think \"Oh no, that\'s not going to work\" and then he would explain \nthat yes, he understood my objection but here is why I was wrong and this is \nhow I need to \nchange my thinking in order to be more successful. <strong>This is what I \nwould like to see more startup books be like</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Rob\'s the guy I want to be in three years. He has working and practical methods for finding \nmarkets and addressing them, he is able to flip, automate, or scale projects, and he \nis aware of his own predeliction to micro-manage, get heads-down in the code, and \nemphasize the wrong things.</p>\n\n<p>And guess what? I do those things too.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, coding isn\'t that important in a tech startup. \nRob estimates it at around 30% of total \neffort, but the more I read the more I\'m thinking it could be as low as 10-15% of \nthe total effort needed. For most of the technical guys I know, that \npiece of information alone represents a huge mindset change.</p>\n\n<p>Lots more goodies like this. This is not theory: it is a step-by-step book. \nRob tells you how to find \nan idea, how to find a market, how to fit the idea to the market, how to test the \nmarket, launch -- it\'s all in there. Great tips like running Adsense ads early on just \nto measure traction. Or getting a Virtual Assistant -- how to find one, how to evaluate \none, and how to use one. Terifficaly good and practical stuff.</p>\n\n<p>This is a good place to bring up an unusual item that Rob mentions. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gMyovJ\">\nmicro-niche-finder</a>. This market research tool has gotten a couple of positive reviews from hackers \nI know and respect. It\'s also appeared on HN a couple of times. Rob recommends it -- \nbut it ain\'t cheap: the full version runs $100. And fair warning:  \nparts of this web site look like something from a used car lot. Flashing text, long streams \nof words -- all of the signs that a webpage is trying to high pressure you into buying. Ugh. \nSo be prepared for that. \nWithin the next month I plan on buying the it myself. I\'ll still use SEOMoz, but \nfrom what I can see this tool can do some nifty stuff with market segmentation that I\'d \nlike to automate. The tool creators also demo several money-making ways of using the tool that is \ndifferent from market research that Rob recommends and I plan on looking into those. \nPlus it has the advantage that it\'s a one-time charge instead of somebody trying to bleed me each \nmonth. I\'m excited about buying it and finding new ways of making money.</p>\n\n<p>But back to the book. I can only give the book two dings. First, there\'s only one opinion, the author\'s. It\'s \nnot like those books where you get twenty stories of how folks made it. I love those books, \nbut I always find them lacking in depth and interactivity. I\'d like to know more in-depth how these \nnuts-and-bolts things are done. So this weakness is also a strength. We trade breadth for \ndepth.</p>\n\n<p>My second ding is that, for me, I had to read other books to get into a mindset where I \nwas ready to hear what Walling had to say. It\'s so good and distilled that, for some, it\'s just \ntoo much all at once. There are a lot of sacred cows punctured in this book, and it\'s a great \nthing they are. I just wonder if I could have read this book five years ago and it would \nhave had the same impact. \nI\'m afraid it would have just washed over me. Some things you have to learn the hard way, probably.</p>\n\n<p>All-in-all, this is the book I would pay for and give to a lot of my friends who \nthink they want to be entrepreneurs -- and I know several of them. Seems like every coder \nI know who has read about \"iFart\" is ready to strike it rich on the net. \nBut we all need to realize it\'s not a simple 1-2-3 journey. \nI\'ve been reading startup books for years and Walling gave me a dozen new things to do. \nHe does a \ngreat job of dispelling a lot of the myths and providing encouragement in the right \narea. It\'s like having a dozen heart-to-heart talks with a coder who already made it. \nHighly recommended. Easily in my top-ten list of startup books. Probably top three, simply \nbecause the book is so targeted towards me. In fact, if I had to pick one \nbook to give my programmer friends just getting started, this is it.</p",

The problem is, you just don\'t see them.\" Over the course of 21 chapters, he shows how to get ahead by treating bosses and clients as valued friends; find better and more exciting ways of doing things; develop \"unique selling propositions\"; persuade people to follow your lead; master the art of selling on the telephone; craft a formal referral system; sell on the Internet; and forge strong, established business relationships.

Tock.\r\n<br/>\r\nThree seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s all you\'ve really got to make the sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With consumers bombarded with thousands of marketing messages a day, they have to make purchasing decisions quickly, which means you have to make the sale just as quickly. There\'s simply no time for you to make any offer besides the one offer that will work and work quickly—The Irresistible Offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what is The Irresistible Offer? Simply put, it\'s the best (and maybe only) true alternative to the traditional form of selling with its sentimental manipulation, marketing trickery, and decreasing effectiveness. The Irresistible Offer is so good and so easy to understand that buying from you becomes a no-brainer for your customers. But it\'s not a one-time special or a \"unique selling proposition.\" The Irresistible Offer is the offer that defines your business and becomes your raison d\'?tre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want an example? Domino\'s Pizza grew from a single store to a $4 billion chain in large part because they gave their customers an offer they couldn\'t refuse—\"thirty minutes or less\" or the pizza was free. The success of that offer is obvious in retrospect. But how do you design The Irresistible Offer for your own business in your own industry? This book shows you how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In The Irresistible Offer, author and New Marketing guru Mark Joyner defines and explains this revolutionary selling philosophy, uses real case studies to show it in effect, and helps you quickly and easily apply it to your own business. He examines the elements that make up The Irresistible Offer and presents a formula for creating one of your own. Plus, Joyner provides practical tools that allow you to estimate the effectiveness of your offer in advance so you can plan accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For too long, selling has been about manipulating a message and manipulating a consumer. The Irresistible Offer presents a new, effective, and ethical way to sell based on what you\'re selling, not how you\'re selling it. Rather than manipulate your customer (who may resent it, after all), Joyner shows you how to manipulate your offer instead—so that customers find it, and your company, truly irresistible.</p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>Author Geoffrey Moore makes the case that high-tech products require marketing strategies that differ from those in other industries. His chasm theory describes how high-tech products initially sell well, mainly to a technically literate customer base, but then hit a lull as marketing professionals try to cross the chasm to mainstream buyers. This pattern, says Moore, is unique to the high-tech industry.</p>\r\n<p>Moore suggests remedies for the problem that can help businesses meet their long-term goals. He coaches marketing professionals on how to move slowly through the gulf, teaching them to create profiles and target specific segments of the population rather than trying to plow right into the mainstream. He cites examples of successful chasm crossings by such companies as Apple, Tandem, Oracle, and Sun, showing what they all had in common and exposing the different weaknesses in their strategies. Moore also assigns responsibility for success to programmers and developers by suggesting they design a \"whole product model.\" Here, because integration tasks are daunting to the mainstream market, all the components of a technological product must be in one package. Moore also describes strategies for competing with rival companies and assessing the best distribution channels for penetrating the target market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written not just for marketing specialists but for all employees whose futures ride on the success of a technical product, Crossing the Chasm delivers crucial information in an engaging, readable tone. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</p>",

Gladwell\'s thesis that ideas, products, messages and behaviors \"spread just like viruses do\" remains a metaphor as he follows the growth of \"word-of-mouth epidemics\" triggered with the help of three pivotal types. These are Connectors, sociable personalities who bring people together; Mavens, who like to pass along knowledge; and Salesmen, adept at persuading the unenlightened. (Paul Revere, for example, was a Maven and a Connector). Gladwell\'s applications of his \"tipping point\" concept to current phenomena--such as the drop in violent crime in New York, the rebirth of Hush Puppies suede shoes as a suburban mall favorite, teenage suicide patterns and the efficiency of small work units--may arouse controversy. For example, many parents may be alarmed at his advice on drugs: since teenagers\' experimentation with drugs, including cocaine, seldom leads to hardcore use, he contends, \"We have to stop fighting this kind of experimentation. We have to accept it and even embrace it.\" While it offers a smorgasbord of intriguing snippets summarizing research on topics such as conversational patterns, infants\' crib talk, judging other people\'s character, cheating habits in schoolchildren, memory sharing among families or couples, and the dehumanizing effects of prisons, this volume betrays its roots as a series of articles for the New Yorker, where Gladwell is a staff writer: his trendy material feels bloated and insubstantial in book form</p>",

Cusumano first identifies the key distinction between software and other businesses. In fact, he believes it is unlike every other business because software doesn\'t have one purpose but becomes whatever function it is handling for a particular customer or company. As a result, software companies must sell both products and services, according to the author. The two typical ways software companies operate is by getting the lion\'s share of revenues from new product sales or via IT consulting. The third way is what the author calls \"hybrid solutions companies—software firms that have some new product sales, but derive as much as 80% of their revenues from services and \"maintenance.\" However, what\'s essential for company success in today\'s rapidly changing technological marketplace is having sufficient flexibility to change to meet customer needs. Citing both real companies including IBM, Netscape, etc., along with academic studies, Cusumano describes the changing face of the software industry over the past two decades. The writing is coherent and, given the somewhat technical subject matter, surprisingly graspable even for technophobes. Still, this is a niche book, apt to appeal to people involved in the world of software, rather than a general business audience.</p>",

The book focuses mainly on big-picture practicalities—the protection of startup capital and the necessity of focusing on high–profit-margin sales—but also expounds on overcoming the sales mindset in favor of the entrepreneurial mentality and facing mistakes with grace and an eye to learning. With a clear, conversational style, the authors give advice on raising capital, maintaining relationships with banks and lenders, customer relations, dealing with unexpected roadblocks and hiring good management. But in the end, they contend that entrepreneurship is not only a passion but a way to achieve a happier, richer, fuller life for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren—and with the right mental habits and skills, anyone can achieve entrepreneurial success.

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>Kim and Mauborgne\'s blue ocean metaphor elegantly summarizes their vision of the kind of expanding, competitor-free markets that innovative companies can navigate. Unlike \"red oceans,\" which are well explored and crowded with competitors, \"blue oceans\" represent \"untapped market space\" and the \"opportunity for highly profitable growth.\" The only reason more big companies don\'t set sail for them, they suggest, is that \"the dominant focus of strategy work over the past twenty-five years has been on competition-based red ocean strategies\"-i.e., finding new ways to cut costs and grow revenue by taking away market share from the competition. With this groundbreaking book, Kim and Mauborgne-both professors at France\'s INSEAD, the second largest business school in the world-aim to repair that bias. Using dozens of examples-from Southwest Airlines and the Cirque du Soleil to Curves and Starbucks-they present the tools and frameworks they\'ve developed specifically for the task of analyzing blue oceans. They urge companies to \"value innovation\" that focuses on \"utility, price, and cost positions,\" to \"create and capture new demand\" and to \"focus on the big picture, not the numbers.\" And while their heavyweight analytical tools may be of real use only to serious strategy planners, their overall vision will inspire entrepreneurs of all stripes, and most of their ideas are presented in a direct, jargon-free manner. Theirs is not the typical business management book\'s vague call to action; it is a precise, actionable plan for changing the way companies do business with one resounding piece of advice: swim for open waters. </p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>Programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools (editors, object managers, version trackers) to generate a certain kind of product (programs) that will operate in some environment (operating systems on hardware assemblies). Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn\'t taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they\'ve discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.\r\nSome of the authors\' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, \"if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras.\" That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You\'ll want a copy of The Pragmatic Programmer for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book.</p>",

Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process. This approach fosters a variety of skills--critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail--that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers. The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks. All the book\'s support materials are available for free on the Web. The Web site includes the environment, teacher guides, exercises for all levels, solutions, and additional projects.</p>",

Free updates online. Purchase includes a free trial membership in the publisher\'s book club where you can select from more than a million books without charge. Excerpt: The ACM Computing Classification System is a subject classification system for computer science devised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The system is comparable to the Mathematics Subject Classification in scope, aims and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area. The system has gone through six revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, and the now current version in 1998. The ACM Computing Classification System is hierarchically structured in four levels: three outer levels, coded by capital letters and numbers, and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains I. Computing Methodologies, which contains:I.2 Artificial Intelligence, which contains:I.2.4 Knowledge representation formalisms and methods, which contains:Temporal logic.Each top-level category has two standard subcategories: \"general\", coded with a \"0\", and \"miscellaneous\", coded with a \"m\". For instance, I.0 denotes the \"general\" subcategory of Computing Methodologies, while I.m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory. Several subtopics are listed as uncoded subject descriptors in these standard subcategories</p>",

These people liked taking things apart and figuring out how they worked, then making them serve purposes they weren\'t originally designed for and sharing the new discoveries with others of like mind. Sure, Huang\'s book is about how to how to turn Microsoft\'s game console into a high-performance, general-purpose personal computer with a small price tag, and it contains lots of details about the how the heavily advertised gizmo is put together. But you can get the technical material on the Web. What\'s valuable about Huang\'s work is that he communicates the pure joy of taking the Xbox apart, figuring out how it works--despite its many designed-in anti-hacking features--and making it do new things. This book reads like the journal of a seventeenth-century voyage of discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a wealth of information in these pages about how to disassemble and reverse-engineer electronics, and Huang is careful to show you what tools you need, and how to use them (don\'t worry if you don\'t know how to use a soldering iron--that\'s covered here). There also are step-by-step guides (complete with photos) to a couple of projects, and interviews with key figures in the Xbox-hacking community. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics covered: How to enjoy a Microsoft Xbox game console without the mindless tedium of playing video games. This book shows you how to open an Xbox, make modifications to it (from a cosmetic LED color change, to putting in a new power supply, to adding a USB connector), and make the changes needed to get Linux running on it. In the process, readers get an education in reverse engineering electronic circuits, as well as in basic electronic techniques (soldering, crimping, etc) and in the intellectual property law that governs hacker activity.</p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>In Hackers Beware, Eric Cole succeeds in explaining how hackers break into computers, steal information, and deny services to machines\' legitimate users. An intended side effect of his documentary efforts is a feeling for how network-connected computers should be configured for maximum resistance to attack. Cole, who works with the attack-monitoring SANS Institute as an instructor and security consultant, conveys to his readers specific knowledge of offensive and defensive weaponry as well as general familiarity with attack strategies and good security practices. Hackers Beware is a good primer and really earns its price by going into enough detail to enable readers to actually do something to make their resources safer. It also enables its readers to understand more specialized security texts, including Stephen Northcutt\'s fine Intrusion Signatures and Analysis.\r\nCole\'s didactic style is largely conversational, embracing the fact that most computer exploits can be conveyed as stories about what hackers want and the steps they take to achieve their goals. He punctuates his prose passages with line drawings that clarify what gets passed among the machines involved in an attack, and pauses frequently to show programs\' user interfaces and passages from their logs. Cole explains all the jargon he uses--a characteristic that alone distinguishes this book from many of its competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics covered: What motivates black-hat hackers, and the technical means they use to go about satisfying their ambitions. General attack strategies--spoofing, password cracking, social engineering, and buffer overflows, among others--are explained, and the tools used to carry them out are catalogued. The same goes for defensive tools and practices.</p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>As the application of object technology-particularly the Java programming language-has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, \"non-optimal\" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as \"refactoring,\" these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple-seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.</p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>You\'re not alone.</p>\r\n<p>At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don\'t want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who\'ve faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on... something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don\'t just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look \"in the wild\". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java\'s built-in pattern support in your own code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you\'re up a creek without a design paddle pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, you want to learn the \"secret language\" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You\'ll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn\'t as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Head First Design Patterns, you\'ll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the \"Trading Spaces\" show. Best of all, in a way that won\'t put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\'ve read a Head First book, you know what to expect - a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.</p>",

            "HtmlDescription":"<p>Twenty years after it topped the bestseller charts, Douglas R. Hofstadter\'s Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is still something of a marvel. Besides being a profound and entertaining meditation on human thought and creativity, this book looks at the surprising points of contact between the music of Bach, the artwork of Escher, and the mathematics of Gödel. It also looks at the prospects for computers and artificial intelligence (AI) for mimicking human thought. For the general reader and the computer techie alike, this book still sets a standard for thinking about the future of computers and their relation to the way we think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hofstadter\'s great achievement in Gödel, Escher, Bach was making abstruse mathematical topics (like undecidability, recursion, and \'strange loops\') accessible and remarkably entertaining. Borrowing a page from Lewis Carroll (who might well have been a fan of this book), each chapter presents dialogue between the Tortoise and Achilles, as well as other characters who dramatize concepts discussed later in more detail. Allusions to Bach\'s music (centering on his Musical Offering) and Escher\'s continually paradoxical artwork are plentiful here. This more approachable material lets the author delve into serious number theory (concentrating on the ramifications of Gödel\'s Theorem of Incompleteness) while stopping along the way to ponder the work of a host of other mathematicians, artists, and thinkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world has moved on since 1979, of course. The book predicted that computers probably won\'t ever beat humans in chess, though Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997. And the vinyl record, which serves for some of Hofstadter\'s best analogies, is now left to collectors. Sections on recursion and the graphs of certain functions from physics look tantalizing, like the fractals of recent chaos theory. And AI has moved on, of course, with mixed results. Yet Gödel, Escher, Bach remains a remarkable achievement. Its intellectual range and ability to let us visualize difficult mathematical concepts help make it one of this century\'s best for anyone who\'s interested in computers and their potential for real intelligence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics Covered: J.S. Bach, M.C. Escher, Kurt Gödel: biographical information and work, artificial intelligence (AI) history and theories, strange loops and tangled hierarchies, formal and informal systems, number theory, form in mathematics, figure and ground, consistency, completeness, Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, recursive structures, theories of meaning, propositional calculus, typographical number theory, Zen and mathematics, levels of description and computers; theory of mind: neurons, minds and thoughts; undecidability; self-reference and self-representation; Turing test for machine intelligence.</p>",

It\'s a carefully written, carefully researched gem that will appeal to anyone who wants to understand computer technology at its essence. Readers learn about number systems (decimal, octal, binary, and all that) through Petzold\'s patient (and frequently entertaining) prose and then discover the logical systems that are used to process them. There\'s loads of historical information too. From Louis Braille\'s development of his eponymous raised-dot code to Intel Corporation\'s release of its early microprocessors, Petzold presents stories of people trying to communicate with (and by means of) mechanical and electrical devices. It\'s a fascinating progression of technologies, and Petzold presents a clear statement of how they fit together.\r\nThe real value of Code is in its explanation of technologies that have been obscured for years behind fancy user interfaces and programming environments, which, in the name of rapid application development, insulate the programmer from the machine. In a section on machine language, Petzold dissects the instruction sets of the genre-defining Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 processors. He walks the reader through the process of performing various operations with each chip, explaining which opcodes poke which values into which registers along the way. Petzold knows that the hidden language of computers exhibits real beauty. In Code, he helps readers appreciate it.</p>",

Such bears, says author Alan Cooper, don\'t dance well, as everyone at the circus can see. What amazes the crowd is that the bear dances at all. Cooper argues that technology (videocassette recorders, car alarms, most software applications for personal computers) consists largely of dancing bears--pieces that work, but not at all well. He goes on to say that this is more often than not the fault of poorly designed user interfaces, and he makes a good argument that way too many devices (perhaps as a result of the designers\' subconscious wish to bully the people who tormented them as children) ask too much of their users. Too many systems (like the famous unprogrammable VCR) make their users feel stupid when they can\'t get the job done.</P\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper, who designed Visual Basic (the programming environment Microsoft promotes for the purpose of creating good user interfaces), indulges in too much name-dropping and self-congratulation (Cooper attributes the quote, \"How did you do that?\" to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, upon looking at one of Cooper\'s creations)--but this appears to be de rigueur in books about the software industry. But those asides are minor. More valuable is the discourse about software design and implementation (\"[O]bject orientation divides the 1000-brick tower into 10 100-brick towers.\"). Read this book for an idea of what\'s wrong with UI design. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics covered: User interfaces--good ones and bad ones--and where they come from. Also, how to improve the ones you create.</p>",

Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noted software expert Robert C.

Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How to tell the difference between good and bad code</li>\r\n<li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code</li>\r\n<li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes</li>\r\n<li>How to format code for maximum readability</li>\r\n<li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic</li>\r\n<li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</li>\r\n</ul>",

Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book\'s lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Dividing an enterprise application into layers</li>\r\n<li>The major approaches to organizing business logic</li>\r\n<li>An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases</li>\r\n<li>Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation</li>\r\n<li>Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions</li>\r\n<li>Designing distributed object interfaces</li>\r\n</ul>",

Eric S. Raymond argues in The Art of UNIX Programming that the excellence of Unix derives as much from the fact that it was (and continues to be) a community effort as from the fact that a lot of smart people have worked to design and build it. Raymond, best known as the author of the open-source manifesto The Cathedral and the Bazaar, says in his preface that this is a \"why-to\" book, rather than a \"how-to\" book. It aims to show new Unix programmers why they should work under the old \"hacker ethic\"--embracing the principles of good software design for its own sake and of code-sharing.</p>\r\n<p>That said, a great deal of valuable practical information appears in this book. Very little of it is in the form of code; most of the practical material takes the form of case studies and discussions of aspects of Unix, all aimed at determining why particular design characteristics are good. In many cases, the people who did the work in the first place make guest appearances and explain their thinking--an invaluable resource. This book is for the deep-thinking software developer in Unix (and perhaps Linux in particular). It shows how to fit into the long and noble tradition, and how to make the software work right</p>",

Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domain-Driven Design fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Getting all team members to speak the same language</li>\r\n<li>Connecting model and implementation more deeply</li>\r\n<li>Sharpening key distinctions in a model</li>\r\n<li>Managing the lifecycle of a domain object</li>\r\n<li>Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways</li>\r\n<li>Making complex code obvious and predictable</li>\r\n<li>Formulating a domain vision statement</li>\r\n<li>Distilling the core of a complex domain</li>\r\n<li>Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model</li>\r\n<li>Applying analysis patterns</li>\r\n<li>Relating design patterns to the model</li>\r\n<li>Maintaining model integrity in a large system</li>\r\n<li>Dealing with coexisting models on the same project</li>\r\n<li>Organizing systems with large-scale structures</li>\r\n<li>Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs</li>\r\n<li>With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.</li>\r\n</ul>",

In Don\'t Make Me Think, author Steve Krug lightens up the subject with good humor and excellent, to-the-point examples.</p>\r\n<p>The title of the book is its chief personal design premise. All of the tips, techniques, and examples presented revolve around users being able to surf merrily through a well-designed site with minimal cognitive strain. Readers will quickly come to agree with many of the book\'s assumptions, such as \"We don\'t read pages--we scan them\" and \"We don\'t figure out how things work--we muddle through.\" Coming to grips with such hard facts sets the stage for Web design that then produces topnotch sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using an attractive mix of full-color screen shots, cute cartoons and diagrams, and informative sidebars, the book keeps your attention and drives home some crucial points. Much of the content is devoted to proper use of conventions and content layout, and the \"before and after\" examples are superb. Topics such as the wise use of rollovers and usability testing are covered using a consistently practical approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of book you can blow through in a couple of evenings. But despite its conciseness, it will give you an expert\'s ability to judge Web design. You\'ll never form a first impression of a site in the same way again.</p>",

He explains the best ways to utilize e-mail lists and newsletters, RSS feeds, online viral marketing, social networking (Facebook, LinkedIn), microblogging (Twitter), online video and radio/podcasts, tele-seminars and webinars, search engine keyword advertising and affiliate program advertising.

The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question \"What is programming?\" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of \"What is data?\" and \"What is a procedure?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book\'s concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming.</p>",

With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book\'s web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.</p>",

Rather than using the conventional (boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language textbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications, including graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader with working programs for inherently more interesting applications. Aimed at both beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle introduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced topics.

When you\'ve read his no-nonsense account of how he invented the World Wide Web, you\'ll want to thank him again, for the sheer coolness of his ideas. One day in 1980, Berners-Lee, an Oxford-trained computer consultant, got a random thought: \"Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked?\" So he created a system to give every \"page\" on a computer a standard address (now called a URL, or Universal Resource Locator), accessible via the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), formatted with the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and visible with the first browser, which did the trick of linking us all up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He may be the most self-effacing genius of the computer age, and his egalitarian mind is evident in the names he rejected for his invention: \"I thought of Mine of Information, or MOI, but moi in French means \'me,\' and that was too egocentric.... The Information Mine (TIM) was even more egocentric!\" Also, a mine is a passive repository; the Web is something that grows inexorably from everyone\'s contributions. Berners-Lee fully credits the colorful characters who helped him get the bobsled of progress going--one colleague times his haircuts to match the solstices--but he\'s stubbornly independent-minded. His quest is to make the Web \"a place where the whim of a human being and the reasoning of a machine coexist in an ideal, powerful mixture.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard-core tech types may wish Berners-Lee had gone into deeper detail about the road ahead: the \"boon and threat\" of XML, free vs. commercial software, VRML 3-D imaging, and such.

In A Guide to the Good Life, William B. Irvine plumbs the wisdom of Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome, and shows how its insight and advice are still remarkably applicable to modern lives.\r\nIn A Guide to the Good Life, Irvine offers a refreshing presentation of Stoicism, showing how this ancient philosophy can still direct us toward a better life. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, Irvine offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Irvine looks at various Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility and shows how to put these techniques to work in our own life. As he does so, he describes his own experiences practicing Stoicism and offers valuable first-hand advice for anyone wishing to live better by following in the footsteps of these ancient philosophers. Readers learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control, and how to deal with insults, grief, old age, and the distracting temptations of fame and fortune. We learn from Marcus Aurelius the importance of prizing only things of true value, and from Epictetus we learn how to be more content with what we have.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, A Guide to the Good Life shows readers how to become thoughtful observers of their own life. If we watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and later reflect on what we saw, we can better identify the sources of distress and eventually avoid that pain in our life. By doing this, the Stoics thought, we can hope to attain a truly joyful life.</p>",

            "BookReviewHtml":"<h2><strong>the review</strong></h2>\r\n<br/><em>Daniel Markham</em>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p>Medieval Christian scholars were faced with a dilemma: their religious beliefs required them to believe that the soul was saved through a relationship with Jesus, yet going through the newly discovered Greek and Roman writings it was obvious to them that great men of virtue and honor were alive many centuries before Jesus lived. How could these people be of such high caliber yet believe such vastly different things?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interesting religious hack, they decided that such people were \"naturally saved\", that is, by observing and living in nature in a noble and perceptive way, they achieved the main goal (at least as far as Christians were concerned) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s quite a cultural achievement - having somebody of a completely different philosophy and world-view endorse a new and strange way of living - and it has never been reproduced in the same way since. When the Greek and Roman writers were discovered (or perhaps \"re-remembered\"), it completely changed the face of western civilization. Everything you see around you is based on it; the modern city, our cosmopolitan way of living, the value of virtue and reasoning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reading about those Christians, it gave me a double problem: what was it about studying the ancients that had such a profound impact on people? It\'s not just the medieval Christians. Everywhere I read, famous people who studied the Greeks and Romans found that it profoundly changed their lives. What was it that made George Washington such a humble person, even though he was for all intents and purposes a new king? What values did Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson have that I lack? Cato was a famous example of this. He was known as a \"true Roman\", a Roman that upheld the empire\'s greatest spirit. Over the centuries lots of folks have come up with ideas about why Rome fell, but during the actual time, many Romans felt that the more Romans drifted away from Cato\'s values, the more the empire was doomed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m a body and mind hacker. I\'ve always believed in messing around with the way my body and mind functions in an effort to make my life better: more productive, more insightful, more joyous, more tranquil. To me, hacking your mind and body has a much more beneficial result than simply hacking together some technology. Technology changes, but you\'re stuck with your mind and body. In pursuit of that goal I\'ve absrobed a lot of material. But as much as I\'ve read, attended lectures, watched videos and read technical works, I\'ve never been able to figure out exactly what it was about the way that the Greeks and Romans lived that had such personally transformative power on some of the people who studied them. Their ideas, sure, stupendously incredible, but personally life-changing? I just didn\'t get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m also a bit of a book-junkie and lurker. I love listening to people recommend books to each other. So when I heard a couple commenters on HackerNews talking about <a href=\"http://amzn.to/bdpFKp\">\"A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy\"</a>, about what a tremendous impact it was making in their life, I knew immediately I had to get the book and read it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until I told my friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Oh sure,\" one wag said sarcastically, \"nothing says \'joy\' like stoicism, right?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ouch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another put it more bluntly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"If the stoics had such great ideas, why are they all gone now?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both good points, and the author had better deliver on them if the book was to be worth the money I paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got the book on a Wednesday, and poured through it in a couple of days. One of the first things I learned was that the word \"stoic\" has changed meaning over the centuries: what we think of as stocism has little to do with what the Romans thought of the word. We think of stoicism as bland, boring, unresponsive. The Romans had various schools of philosophy which thought of Stoicism as just another way to lead one\'s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today if you ask a philosopher how to lead a good life, you\'re likely to get into a long boring discussion about linguistics and the meaning of language. Back then the Romans understood that philosophy was engaged with the big questions. If you ask me, somewhere philosophers have forgotten what their jobs are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several times while reading I was amazed at the insight the Stoics had. Many times I said to myself, \"If I had only read this when I was a teenager! How much better my life would have been. How much better I would handled such-and-such a situation\" Irvine managed not only to answer my questions, but to provide a glimpse into what the big deal was all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I won\'t go into too much detail -- I\'m not an expert and I don\'t want to muddy the waters by what little I absorbed. I\'m happy to say that I loved the author\'s description of Stoicism as \"Zen Buddhism for analytical people\" which describes the fact that Stocism is not a religion, just a set of tools to lead a better life. It also describes the purpose of Stoicism: to have a joyous, happy, fun-filled life by better learning the art of living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m a firm believer that there are several subjects that are critical to functioning in a modern society that we are not teaching children: economics, calculus, statistics, creative writing, business, negotiation, and now I add to that list, stoicism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will the book have this huge impact on my life? I don\'t know. I have my doubts. At 45 it\'s probably a very difficult thing to do to change course. Over the years I\'ve read a lot of upbeat books, and I\'ve been excited about my fair share of them. As part of that experience, I\'ve become a very cynical person, and I\'m always on the lookout for fads. I think for such a major change so late it would require an instructor and a lot of time. But who knows? I\'m eagerly looking forward to integrating Stoic practices that I am learning into my lifestyle. Like many things, the concepts seem easy enough, it\'s just actually doing them that might be tough. Ask me again in ten years. I might have a better answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the best, most awesome part of this book, hands-down, was to read the excitement and insight that William Irvine brings to the table and to get a glimpse of what it was really like to be a \"real\" Roman. He really understands who Cato was, and he really understands what it meant to be a Stoic. I\'ve gained a huge insight into what about the way those folks lived - not just their ideas - and how what they learned can be of immediate impact to me today, right now. I want to learn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past decade, I\'ve been hard at work on my belief stack. Existentialism, Fundamentalist Agnosticism, and now Stoicism. I find that Stoicism fits nicely in with the other two, giving both life that neither had on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great history, great ideas, great insights on the best way to live and an enjoyable read - what\'s there not to like?</p>\r\n\r\n<br/>Daniel is a life-long hacker and founder of HN-Books.

Outside that again is the Transcend, full of unguessable, godlike \"Powers.\" When human meddling wakes an old Power, the Blight, this spreads like a wildfire mind virus that turns whole civilizations into its unthinking tools. And the half-mythical Countermeasure, if it exists, is lost with two human children on primitive Tines World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serious complications follow. One paranoid alien alliance blames humanity for the Blight and launches a genocidal strike. Pham Nuwen, the man who knows about Countermeasure, escapes this ruin in the spacecraft Out of Band--heading for more violence and treachery, with 500 warships soon in hot pursuit. On his destination world, the fascinating Tines are intelligent only in combination: named \"individuals\" are small packs of the doglike aliens. Primitive doesn\'t mean stupid, and opposed Tine leaders wheedle the young castaways for information about guns and radios. Low-tech war looms, with elaborately nested betrayals and schemes to seize Out of Band if it ever arrives. The tension becomes extreme... while half the Beyond debates the issues on galactic Usenet.</p>",

I asked myself that a couple of weeks \r\r\nago when I decided to take off a week and do something fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had strict criteria: no long-running series books. I really don\'t want to be \r\r\nreading Astro-Star Trooper serial #73. No fantasy books. Hey, I really like \r\r\nfantasy books at times, but I really wanted something with some intellectual grit \r\r\nto it. Something with a bit of hard science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And most importantly, something with a good review from various readers, \r\r\nespecially hackers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I chose this book, and I wasn\'t disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\'http://amzn.to/fGkPk6\'>\"A Fire Upon the Deep\"</a> tells the story of \r\r\na galaxy in which the physics change depending on how far you are out from the \r\r\ncenter. It\'s a galaxy where there are millions of civilizations, all interacting \r\r\nwith each other over some form of galactic net. History has existed for millions \r\r\nof years, so between the data storage, number of communication nodes, and \r\r\nemptiness of space, you get a universe that is realistic enough to believe, yet \r\r\nstill has aspects of our current world meshed in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I haven\'t read that many reviews of AFOD, but I noticed that it had an \r\r\nincredible number of reviews over at Amazon, mostly positive. That put it on my \r\r\nshort list. Once I actively started hearing other hackers recommending it to each \r\r\nother (\"you may love or hate this book, but either way you should read it\") I \r\r\nknew it was high on my list of holiday books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t want to get too much into the plot -- that would spoil it for you. But \r\r\nI\'ll say that I really liked Vinge\'s insight into how tech and people work \r\r\ntogether. I liked the pacing and character vignettes in the book, and I liked his \r\r\ndepiction of an alien medieval civilization and the creatures that lived there. \r\r\nPlenty of food for thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What didn\'t I like? I didn\'t like that a couple of the main characters sounded \r\r\nsuspiciously like potted plants. I didn\'t like the ending -- I thought it was a \r\r\nbit forced and happened too quickly. I was expecting a last section to open up \r\r\nwhich never materialized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Vernor is a decent storyteller, with a solid footing in science and \r\r\ninteresting opinions on the way we relate to machines. In the end, I found myself \r\r\nwanting to read more of what he\'s written, and that\'s a good thing.</p>",

A \"must read!\" \"couldn\'t \r\r\nstop reading!\" \"kept me up late at night\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very rarely is that true, however. It\'s gotten so that I laugh every time I \r\r\nread the backs of these books. To hear the blurb writers tell it, every book in \r\r\nthe bookstore is a great piece of monumental fiction that mesmerizes and seduces \r\r\nthe readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bleh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But every now and then -- about once every couple of years -- I really do find \r\r\na book that I get attached to and have a hard time putting down. \"The Sparrow\" \r\r\nwas just such a book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t want to give away the plot, but the theme of the book is how different \r\r\npeoples interact with each other. There are a lot of examples in history: how the \r\r\neuropeans met the natives new world, or how the Spanish met the Aztecs, for \r\r\ninstance. In this case we\'ve got a bunch of Jesuits meet an alien civilization in \r\r\nthe Alpha Centauri system, but it\'s the dramatic question that\'s important. \"What \r\r\nif we had to make physical contact with an alien civilization? How would it \r\r\nactually work?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, the author takes two storylines and intermingles them together, \r\r\neach of which is captivating in it\'s own right. We get into the nature of good \r\r\nand evil, the meaning of language and communication, and the way new languages \r\r\nand cultures are woven into our own fabric of experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, it\'s a big old philosophical roller coaster ride full of aliens, \r\r\nspace travel, religion, war -- all the good stuff. I had a blast reading it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author was an academic before writing this book, an anthropologist, and it \r\r\nshows. It\'s a thoughtful book. Yes, there\'s action, but this is a book that makes \r\r\nyou ask questions of yourself, not one in which you read along as some super \r\r\nhero/detective spy does all sorts of impossible things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at wikipedia, the book won many awards, and there\'s also a sequel! \r\r\nYay! Although it\'s from 1992, I didn\'t find anything at all dated about the book, \r\r\nand it was very enjoyable to have a somewhat realistic notion of interstellar \r\r\ntravel that didn\'t involve pixie dust and dilithium crystals. Relativistic \r\r\neffects were considered -- also a bit unusual -- and the universe she created \r\r\n\"makes sense\", that is there are no glaring edges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I\'ve become one of those \"must read!\" book blurbers, I owe it to tell \r\r\nyou why I had hard time putting the book down. In a word, teasing. Mary Doria \r\r\nRussell tells you a little bit of this, a little bit of that, but never really \r\r\ncomes out and tells you what the heck is going on. You get little pieces of the \r\r\npuzzle as you read along, which she drops in at the optimum moments. I found \r\r\nmyself mumbling \"Just tell me X!\" a couple of times. Great fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I picked up four books to read over my recent holiday. Two of them were \r\r\naverage. Another was very good, \"A Fire Upon the Deep\", but \"The Sparrow\" is my \r\r\nfavorite of the lot. I\'ve already downloaded the sequel on my kindle and can\'t \r\r\nwait to get around to reading it.</p>",

The story has the same sense of epic vastness despite happening mostly in one isolated solar system. Here there\'s a world of intelligent spider creatures who traditionally hibernate through the \"Deepest Darkness\" of their strange variable sun\'s long \"off\" periods, when even the atmosphere freezes. Now, science offers them an alternative... Meanwhile, attracted by spider radio transmissions, two human starfleets come exploring--merchants hoping for customers and tyrants who want slaves. Their inevitable clash leaves both fleets crippled, with the power in the wrong hands, which leads to a long wait in space until the spiders develop exploitable technology. Over the years Vinge builds palpable tension through multiple storylines and characters. In the sky, hopes of rebellion against tyranny continue despite soothing lies, brutal repression, and a mental bondage that can convert people into literal tools. Down below, the engagingly sympathetic spiders have their own problems. In flashback, we see the grandiose ideals and ultimate betrayal of the merchant culture\'s founder, now among the human contingent and pretending to be a senile buffoon while plotting, plotting... Major revelations, ironies, and payoffs follow. A powerful story in the grandest SF tradition. </p>",

            "BookReviewHtml":"<h2><strong>the review</strong></h2>\n<p>Why does so much science fiction suck?</p>\n\n<p>When I read sci-fi, I want engaging fiction that asks a simple \"what if\" \nquestion. Fiction that engages me with lots of science -- things I can reason \nabout on my own. So many times what we call \"sci-fi\" is just space opera with a \ncouple of blasters thrown in. It\'s all magic. It\'s fiction, sure, but there \nisn\'t a lot of science going on.</p>\n\n<p>\"A Deepness in the Sky\" isn\'t like that. The author, a computer science \nprofessor, has writte a story with lots of relativistic time dilations, physics \nanomolies, and wonder of wonders, lots of hacker stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Vernor Vinge is a sci-fi writer for hackers.</p>\n\n<p>Deepness is a prequel to one of his other books, the award-winning \"A Fire \nUpon the Deep\". In \"A Deepness in the Sky\", Vinge asks several great \n\"what if\" questions, one of which \nis about our relationship to our work. How does technology contribute or distract us \nfrom a healthy relationship to our work? \nWhat is a helathy relationship? \nThere are several other threads, most of \nwhich I don\'t want to spoil for you. But they\'re all exploring really good \nquestions.</p>\n\n<p>Best of all? It\'s full of hacker goodness. He understands the role computers \nplay in our lives. One of the things I loved the most about reading him was the \nfact that he \"got\" how important networking was, and could describe it\'s \nstrengths and weaknesses. In one scene, a character realizes that there are several \nthousand nodes accessible from his current spot on the net, but that their remaining \ncharge is limited. \"Depending on usage, he could still get a lot of information \nout of the nodes if he set the packets up right\"</p>\n\n<p>That\'s cool stuff. In another scene we go into the various protocol layers of the \nspace-faring technology being used. We talk about the mathematical difficulties \nof large gobs of fluids in microgravities, or the nature of a culture that could \nevolve in a system with a variable star.</p>\n\n<p>None of it is terribly deep -- this book is for anybody -- but it\'s all \nstuff that years ago would have been \ncompletely too far in the weeds. Not any more. Now when characters talk about \nlight-speed limitations on network latency, it\'s something that anybody with \nsatellite interrnet can identify with. When they talk about layers upon layers of code, \nit\'s something that anybody with a modern complex OS can grasp. Or any modern \nprogrammer.</p>\n\n<p>The future is in computers and technology, and a writer that knows computers is \ngoing to do a better job at describing the future than one who doesn\'t.</p>\n\n<p>Did I have problems with the book? Sure. It wasn\'t perfect. \nI felt it went on a bit too long, took too long to wrap \nup. At one point I think Vinge showed his manuscript to somebody else, because after \nthat he spends a bit of time defending his description of some of the aliens  \nThe author protests a bit too much. Because it\'s a prequel, there is just a bit \ntoo much detail.</p>\n\n<p>But overall this was really good science fiction. The long format and the richness \nof all the character threads make the book immersive. \nI really like the way he describes something without explaining it, then you end up \nfiguring out what it was as the book unfolds. Late in the book I was getting these \n\"ah-ha!\" moments about things I had read in the first few pages. Very neat.\nWhile away from reading, I found \nmyself thinking about the characters and problems they faced. At the \nend I was hanging on pins and needles as the final scenes played out. I can \nsee why this storyline won a Hugo Award.</p>\n\n<p>Books are so much better than movies</p>\n\n<p>What makes good science fiction? Stuff that makes you think. Stuff that sucks you \nin. Stuff that takes you for a wild ride. Stuff that you talk about.</p>\n\n<p>This book was all of that. It was a fun diversion and great book if you\'re a hacker \nand getting a little tired of all the lame sci-fi you usually get. Fair warning \nthough: read many of Vinge\'s books and you\'ll find it difficult to go back to the \nother stuff.</p>",

First, you analyze your own personality type and determine your placement on the scales of extrovert/introvert, sensor/intuitive, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. The book then teaches you about the clues that indicate other people\'s personality type, including speaking style, body language, and occupation. You test yourself by reading a few scenarios and personality typing the characters described. You put the system to work by learning approaches to \"speedreading\" people in person and on the phone using skill-building exercises. Finally, you learn how to communicate effectively with people who are a different type or temperament than you. The Art of Speedreading People is intriguing and useful, especially for those who work in a sales, service, teaching, or managerial position, or any job where effective and positive communication is paramount.</p>",

            "BookReviewHtml":"<h2>the review</h2>\r\n\n<p>Odds are that you and I will never be famous for running a startup.<p>\n\n<p>Sure, we may have a startup. We may even get rich from a startup, but we\'ll never be a Bill Gates. We\'ll \nprobably never even go to one of those cool startup bootcamps.<p>\n\n<p>Why? As for me, I\'m old, ornery, ugly, and generally obnoxious. How about you? Perhaps \nyou live outside the United States. Perhaps you can\'t afford to move to SV. Perhaps \nyou don\'t have a cofounder. Perhaps you just aren\'t good at making demo videos.<p>\n\n<p>Because, at the end of the day, one thing is true: a lot of what it takes to \nbe a famous startup founder boils down to one thing: a beauty contest. \"People are the most important \nthing\" one guy says. And since nobody likes to be around people they don\'t like, \nlet\'s face it, only the \npopular kids are going to be going to YCombinator and appearing in TechCrunch. \nYou and I are probably not them.<p>\n\n<p>But don\'t give up! This just means we have to work three times as hard \nand three times as smart. With the right \nmentors, enough smart work, and a willingness to fail fast many times over, anybody \ncan make it. That\'s where books like \"Do More Faster\" help.<p>\n\n<p>This book is a collection of short articles written by folks who either run or have \nwent through the TechStars program, a startup bootcamp with locations in several U.S. cities. \nBy reading it, you get to see what founders were thinking as they made critical decisions \nand grew their companies while attending the camp.</p>\n\n<p>I really liked this book, and don\'t have much bad to say about it, but it\'s pointless \nto write a review unless you can both offer constructive criticism and let the reader know \nwhat flaws the book had, so let\'s get to it.</p>\n\n<p>Please, enough with the conference articles. Ever been to a conference or a seminar? \nYou know how everybody that presents will tell you a story of pain and misery, all until \nthey did something magic, after which it was all bluebirds and sunshine? Then you \nknow what I\'m talking about. This book didn\'t overdo it, but I really enjoyed the \narticles where people admitted to being lost and confused much more than the ones where \neverything was perfect, if only just a little bit. \nBecause let\'s face it: lost and confused, looking for advice is how some of us feel,\nor we wouldn\'t be reading the book in the first place. \nThere were a couple of what-went-wrong articles. Totally awesome. \nThe book was well on the side of being practical, but a tiny bit more slice-of-life and a \ntiny bit less I-am-master-of-the-universe would have made it even better. \nBecuase when I hear a conference article, the first thing I want to do is to challenge the author.</p>\n\n<p>So why not do that? I really wish some of \nthe articles would have had the 2 or 3 most common responses/mistakes \nto their advice and how those objections are handled. The articles gave me a great \nfeeling of being in a meeting with these guys -- so much that I wanted to ask \nquestions! I feel that having a few question and answers for each section would \ngive the book a better feeling of interactivity and add to its usefulness.</p>\n\n<p>But fair warning: this is a <strong>real</strong> startup book, full of advice \nabout corporation formation, raising money (or not), work habits, and 82(b) elections. \nIf you are looking for a motivational book or a book to get you excited about staying \nwith your startup, this probably isn\'t it. This is a personal-opinion, how do I do X, nuts-and-bolts book.</p>\n\n<p>And whatever you do, don\'t get the ebook! I normally don\'t care what kind of book I get. In fact, I have been \ngoing kindle crazy for the past few months. But this book really should be a hardcover book. \nHere\'s why: the format of the book is dozens of short articles with pictures and such,  \ngiving you the feeling of being there and talking to these founders. The problem is that \nit\'s such a good book that good advice can easily pass you by and slip through your fingers.\nHere are some gems I caught. Many more certainly got away.\n\n<ul><em>\n<li>Focus on the smallest possible problem you could solve that would potentially be useful</li>\n<li>We learned that very few people care how you accomplish something. Instead, these people care more about whether you create value for your end user</li>\n<li>If you can\'t quit no matter how hard you try, then you have a chance to succeed</li>\n<li>when presented with exponential growth, remember that people tend to drastically overestimate what will happen in the short term, but will profoundly underestimate what happens over longer time spans</li>\n<li>If you are innovating, you actually don\'t know what your product needs to be. Furthermore, your customers don\'t either. No one does</li>\n<li>There is one thing that the hundred of founders I meet each year have in common, and that is that their plan is wrong. Sometimes it\'s the big things, sometimes it\'s the little things, but the plan is always wrong</li>\n</em></ul>\nSeriously. The book is full of great stuff like that. You\'ll be reading along and suddenly you\'ll go \"Wow! I need to remember that!\"</p>\n\n<p>So do yourself a favor and get the physical book, use a highlighter as a bookmark, and make a lot of notes and \nhighlight a lot. You\'ll \nwant to go back and collapse it all together when you\'re done.</p>\n\n<p>I really enjoyed this book. it was well constructed, well edited, and did one thing and did it well. \nAnd in the process I became a fan of Boulder, Colorado, which was totally unexpected. \nI found that I almost completely got in the spirit of the TechStars group by watching them (lots of pictures too) and listening to \nthem in their own words. It was the closest I\'ve ever come to feeling like I was part of a \nstartup bootcamp, and I\'ve been reading startup blogs and books for years.</p>\n\n<p>You and I will probably never be a famous startup founder, but there\'s great news: the guys who teach, train, and grow \nstartups are making a concerted effort to show the rest of the world how it\'s done. \"Do More Faster\" is a teriffic book at \ndoing just that. I look forward to more great material from TechStars. Great job, guys.</p>",

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that\'s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Syntax</li>\r\n<li>Objects</li>\r\n<li>Functions</li>\r\n<li>Inheritance</li>\r\n<li>Arrays</li>\r\n<li>Regular expressions</li>\r\n<li>Methods</li>\r\n<li>Style</li>\r\n<li>Beautiful features</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you\'ll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you\'ll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you\'re managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

And it was a seriously rocking resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, I learned early on that recruiters have thousands of resumes in their systems, and each job had a mostly random assortment of skills, \r\nmethodologies, software products, and job descriptions. They had to use computers to match the resumes to the jobs. It was just too hard to do otherwise. \r\nSince computers searched by keyword, resumes that had more keyword matches would appear ahead of those that did not. My first page was a specialized, \r\ntargeted easy list of bullets to a human reader \r\n about why I was the best person for a particular job (Or just why I was a great person. \r\n My modesty does not bear close inspection.). The other pages were a detailed account of each job, \r\n the software products, the methodologies, the job descriptions, the time periods, and how I made a difference there.\r\n All of it was in a very human-friendly (and useful) format. By putting something in for both the human and the computer, I was able to \r\n help the human a lot more than if I had simply written the resume stricty for humans or strictly for computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led to a lot of exciting gigs, and it was a great introduction to beginning to learn Search-Engine Optimization, or SEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, no matter what I had done in the world, no matter how good of a consultant I was, \r\n<em>unless somebody read my resume none of that would matter</em>. Likewise, even if somebody read my resume, \r\n<em>unless that person got real value from reading my resume, none of that would matter</em>. \r\nSo it was in my best interests to create a resume that could easily be consumed by both humans and computers. \r\nIt was something I had to know and do in order to get good jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEO is just like that, only for websites.</o>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SEO is the art of configuring your web content so that people using search \r\nengines can find it more easily. Just like my resume, no matter how good your \r\nweb content is, unless people can find it and get some valuable use out of it, it\'s \r\nnot making an impact in the world. That means SEO is for anybody who is creating web \r\ncontent for other people to consume: apps, blogs, corporate sites, startups, \r\ncharity organizations, people selling ebooks -- whatever -- they all need to \r\nknow SEO if they want more people dropping by. That means -- like it or not -- \r\nSEO is for all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of this book really know their business. It\'s chock-full \r\nof good advice and tips on improving SEO, both on the server and in the content. \r\nIt wasn\'t without it\'s flaws, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to admit I found parts tedious, though. Not completely boring, but dull \r\nenough that I had to struggle with absorbing the information. Several times I \r\nfound myself skimming over entire sections. Why would I need to learn SWOT \r\nagain? Why would consulting best practices be in a book about SEO? Why do I \r\nneed a review of these tools? I already know them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think part of my problem was that this is a book designed \r\nto help SEO professionals start out their careers. That means it\'s \r\nboth broad and deep. So it has advice on consulting, team organization -- \r\neven advice for how clients can find good SEO employees or consultants. \r\nThat\'s great information, but for some reason it wasn\'t what I was expecting. \r\nI was expecting just pure SEO information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There also was a bit of re-hash. If I read one more time how good Google \r\nWebmaster tools are, or how 301 redirects are better than 302 redirects, or how \r\nan accidental NoIndex in a bots file can ruin your day? I think I would have \r\nran screaming from the room. Three or four times? Plenty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But please don\'t think this was a bad book. Far from it. In the computer world, \r\nthose of us who read a lot have to learn to plow through material that sometimes \r\nseems dry. Many times, the best foundational books are as much reference as \r\nnarrative. I consider this a foundational book about SEO, and, like many other \r\nbooks of this nature, that means it can get a bit dry at times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an aside, more and more I see books that look a lot like blog postings stuck together. \r\nThis is probably something that sounds cooler to do than it actually is. \r\nThere\'s a lot of repetition, there\'s a lot of lists. \r\nSeems like every few pages there was a \"There are 17 ways to do X\" followed by a \r\nvery detailed list of the 17 different ways. That type of information is \r\n<em>descriptive</em>, not <em>instructive</em>. Also this book was strange \r\nin that it had a lot of links -- not really sure what to do with a link on \r\na Kindle I\'m certainly not going to start web surfing from a book, but it \r\nwas good to have the various material sourced.\r\n(I found out later that the book has it\'s own web site. Puzzle solved.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which leads me to think that this book is probably just as strong as a \r\nreference manual as an end-to-end work. I\'m not used to using my Kindle for \r\nreference manuals -- I like my reference manuals dog-eared and lying open \r\naround the desk, thank you very much -- so I naturally I would recommend that \r\nothers purchase the hard copy of the book unless they are comfortable with \r\nusing their kindle like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found this book to be a solid overview of SEO. In fact, \r\nthe book it reminded me most of was Petzold\'s first edition of \r\n\"Programming Windows\": the book that everybody had to read back \r\nin the 90s in order to really \r\nunderstand what was going on inside a windows program. \"The Art of SEO\" is \r\njust like that for SEO. It\'s a gateway book. A badge. I wouldn\'t want to work \r\nwith anybody in the SEO world who hadn\'t read it and could converse about \r\neverything in it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair to the topic, however, parts of SEO drives me nuts. Unlike my resume, \r\ncreating web content that is SEO optimzied has become so complicated that it\'s not a simple matter of \r\ndoing a few things in order to help both yourself and the consumer. Lots of \r\nfolks abuse SEO in order to trick folks and make money, and the search engines \r\nrespond by making their programs more complex. The system has gotten so complex and non-understandable to me it \r\nresembles magic much more than science.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, SEO is like sending your resume in to see how it ranks -- where the \r\nranking program is held secret, the people helping you don\'t trust you, and you \r\nhave to mail in your resume and wait 3 months to see how it performs. Not \r\nexactly a friendly or easy environment to work in for those of us used to \r\n3-minute C++ compiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed to me that a lot of times there was good information written between the lines. What a strange world where the \r\nguy you pay to write the book wouldn\'t tell you if there was a easy way to do what you \r\nwant even if he knew it! It\'s because of fear of abuse, of course, but it makes for \r\ncrazy reading. There were a few times where I really felt connected to the writer \r\n-- such as the comment that Google \r\nprobably overstates their ability to find paid links -- but I got the \r\ndistinct impression that there was a lot that was unsaid. This isn\'t a \r\nding against this particular book -- it\'s the nature or \r\nthe industry.</p>\r\n\r\nMy own conclusion from visiting this bizarro world is to be careful to separate what search engines \r\nand other folks think people want from what \r\n<em>you</em> think people want. After all, the entire point of \r\nbeing a publisher is to have your own unique views on what people want. \r\nCall me old fashioned, but I wouldn\'t rely on a bunch of smart programmers to \r\ndo that for me. The search engine guys will say something along similar lines: \r\n\"Write for the reader, not the search engine\" but of course that\'s easy for them \r\nto just say. In the real world if nobody finds your content there is no reader \r\nto write for.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But I\'m really not trying to rag on anybody. Search engine guys \r\nmust have an incredibly difficult job. I don\'t envy them -- it \r\nsounds like hardcore coding. And I sure don\'t envy SEO consultants who are \r\ndealing with logical, reasonable \r\npeople who just want to know how to reach the top one spot in Google search. \r\nSEO ain\'t like advertising, and it aint\' like marketing. \r\nIt\'s probably most like PR work, only different. So there\'s a huge learning curve for everybody \r\ninvolved with it no matter where you come from. One guy said this book was probably \r\ngood for marketers. \'Nuff said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it all changes. One year widgets with links are good. \r\nThe next year they are bad. The following one they are good, but \r\nonly in certain situations. Then the story becomes \r\nthat the principle was always the same, just the \r\nimplementations of the rules varied from time to time. \r\nMany times it felt like we were \r\n\r\ngetting our fortune told or consulting the Oracle at Delphi \r\nmore than learning a science -- the book was full of links to \r\ninterviews and articles that famous person X said, as if by somehow parsing \r\nthe tea leaves the rest of us \r\n\r\ncould figure out exactly what to do. Very strange business indeed. \r\nYou don\'t find C++ programmers sitting around reading interviews \r\nwith Bjarne Stroustrup\'s to figure out how C++ works, yet this \r\ntype of prognosticating seems common in the SEO industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <em>everything</em> about SEO is like that, making it very \r\nfrustrating for programmers coming at this from a logical, boolean \r\nstandpoint. This isn\'t \"Learning C\", and There is a reason why the \r\n\r\nbook is titled \"The <strong>Art</strong> of SEO\" \r\nIt\'s not clear cut. If there\'s a problem, sometimes \r\nit sounds like a bunch of guys at Bing or Google sit around and just decide \r\n\r\nwhether or not they like your site. If they like you, \r\nyou stay in the index. If not, you don\'t. Then they go and make up rules \r\nafterwards. Maybe. And if you\'re lucky you\'ll hear about them. If your site \r\ngets dinged you can fill a form out -- but don\'t expect them to tell you why \r\nand don\'t expect to actually talk to a person.\r\n\r\nEven if you learned SEO perfectly today, in ten years all of what you knew would probably be garbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all drives me to distraction. In fact, the entire business of trying to \r\nsatisfy both a human reader and some set of random unknown computer programs \r\nthat you just hear thirdhand rumors about would be fodder for a wonderful \r\nfarcical comedy -- if tens billions of dollars and a huge chunk of the \r\nworld\'s economy didn\'t depend on it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you\'re a logical thinker, and have problems with fuzziness, buckle up. It\'s going to be a rough ride. But I can\'t \r\nemphasize enough how important all of this is. \r\nOrganic search engine results lead to more opportunities to grow than any other thing I\'ve come across. \r\nThey are a true \"force multiplier\" for your startup idea. \r\nYou can either try to chase down every person in the world to tell about your content -- \r\nor you can learn to help them find it. And as much as I rag on the system, everybody is doing the best \r\njob they can. Getting people to what they want while staying ahead of the con artists is just a really tough problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The Art of SEO\" doesn\'t give you all the answers, but it provides you with \r\nan understanding of what all the questions are. It gives you a bunch of places \r\nwhere you can go to work today, like in-site anchors, optimizing your server, \r\ninterpreting your server logs, or checking for canonical problems. An \r\nunderstanding of all of this is what translates great content that nobody \r\nsees into great content that everybody likes. It lets you understand how \r\nmuch of a difference just a few bytes can make in how many readers visit. \r\nIt gives you skills in tweaking stuff that multiply everything you do. \r\nAnd for that it is easily one of the most valuable (if frustrating at times) \r\nbooks I have read. I\'d buy it again in a heartbeat, and probably spend the \r\nentire time reading it grumbling to myself.</p>",
