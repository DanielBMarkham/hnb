Enabled by the emergence of global process networks, firms will undergo a three-stage transformation: deepening specialization within firms; mobilizing best-in-class capabilities across enterprises; and, ultimately, accelerating learning across broad networks of enterprises.<br /><br />Hagel and Seely Brown discuss the strategic levers that will accelerate this migration, and they outline a new approach to strategy development that will help companies capture this shifting source of strategic advantage.<br /><br />Calling for a forceful reinvention of business strategy and the very nature of the firm itself, this bold and forward-looking book reveals what every company must do today to become tomorrow’s market leader.<br /></p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "3", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/9QhicH"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "8", QuestionID: "5", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "8", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "5" }, { ID: "8", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "3" }, { ID: "8", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "2" }, { ID: "8", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "2"}]}] }, { ID: "4", Title: "Insanely Great", PublicationYear: "2000", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_4_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_4_large.png", HtmlDescription: '<p>Back in the early 1980s, word spread about an inviting little personal computer that used something called a mouse and smiled at you when you turned it on.

Instead, Dennis wants to demystify the money-getting process, and his straight-talking, honest advice makes a refreshing change in this oversaturated field. Using humorous examples from his own business life, Dennis's advice, from The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors to The Power of Focus, might sound like conventional fare, but delivered in his signature bawdy, British style, it's altogether more entertaining—and more practical.

Drawing extensively on psychosocial studies on memory, emotion and motivation, their study is couched in terms of "stickiness"—that is, the art of making ideas unforgettable. They start by relating the gruesome urban legend about a man who succumbs to a barroom flirtation only to wake up in a tub of ice, victim of an organ-harvesting ring. What makes such stories memorable and ensures their spread around the globe? The authors credit six key principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. (The initial letters spell out "success"—well, almost.) They illustrate these principles with a host of stories, some familiar (Kennedy\'s stirring call to "land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth" within a decade) and others very funny (Nora Ephron\'s anecdote of how her high school journalism teacher used a simple, embarrassing trick to teach her how not to "bury the lead").

They can draw up business plans, have meetings with venture capitalists, maybe even get funded and actually launch a start-up. However, in The Monk and the Riddle, Silicon Valley sage Randy Komisar reasons that's only half the equation for success. And it may not be the important half. Komisar has worked with a number of companies--Apple, LucasArts Entertainment (the gaming division of George Lucas's empire), and WebTV among them--and has come to a rather startling conclusion: if you can't see yourself doing this business for the rest of your life, don't start it. In other words, he wants to see passion and purpose in business, not just spreadsheets and a by-the-numbers business model.</p>\r\n<p>To illustrate, Komisar takes the reader through a hypothetical Silicon Valley start-up, with an eager entrepreneur named Lenny trying to get funding for an online casket-selling business. As Komisar helps Lenny find the real purpose of the business, the passion behind the revenue projections, he reflects back on his life as an entrepreneur. Komisar emerges as a master storyteller, the kind of guy you'd feel honored to share a bottle of wine with.

Each law is presented with illustrations of how it works based on actual companies and their marketing strategies. For example, the "Law of Focus" states that the most powerful concept in marketing is "owning" a word in the prospect\'s mind, such as Crest\'s owning cavities and Nordstrom\'s owning service.

Lewis (Liar's Poker) has created an absorbing and extremely literate profile of one of America's most successful entrepreneurs. Clark has created three companiesASilicon Graphics, Netscape (now part of America Online) and HealtheonAeach valued at more than $1 billion by Wall Street. Lewis was apparently given unlimited access to Clark, a man motivated in equal parts by a love of the technology he helps to create and a desire to prove something to a long list of people whom he believes have done him wrong throughout his life (especially his former colleagues at Silicon Graphics). As Lewis looks at the various roles of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and programmers and at how these very different mindsets fit together in the anatomy of big deals, he gives readers a sense of how the Valley works. But the heart of the book remains Clark, who simultaneously does everything from supervise the creation of what may be the world's largest sloop to creating his fourth company (currently in the works). Lewis does a good job of putting Clark's accomplishments in context, and if he is too respectful of Clark's privacy (several marriages and children are mentioned but not elaborated on), he provides a detailed look at the professional life of one of the men who have changed the world as we know it.</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "35", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/bA2jL5" }, { ID: "56", Format: "E-Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/aFMmzt" }, { ID: "57", Format: "AudioBook", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/cEohVw"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "62", QuestionID: "13", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "62", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "4" }, { ID: "62", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "3" }, { ID: "62", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "2" }, { ID: "62", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "1"}]}] }, { ID: "26", Title: "Bulletproof Web Design: Improving flexibility and protecting against worst-case scenarios with XHTML and CSS (2nd Edition)", PublicationYear: "2007", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_26_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_26_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>No matter how visually appealing or content-packed a Web site may be, if it's not adaptable to a variety of situations and reaching the widest possible audience, it isn't really succeeding.

Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to "the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people." He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person\'s point of view and "arousing in the other person an eager want." You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, "let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers," and "talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person." Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. </p>', VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "112", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/deyKgS" }, { ID: "138", Format: "E-Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/95g0U9" }, { ID: "139", Format: "AudioBook", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/9xR6qp"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "125", QuestionID: "12", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "125", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "125", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "6" }, { ID: "125", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "125", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6"}]}] }, { ID: "67", Title: "eBoys: The First Inside Account of Venture Capitalists at Work", PublicationYear: "2001", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_67_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_67_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>If you want to understand the 1990s, you have to understand venture capitalists.

Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus -- which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided.

Working programmers use compilers every day and count heavily on their correctness and reliability. A compiler must accept the standard definition of the programming language so that source code will be portable across platforms. A compiler must generate efficient object code. Perhaps more important, a compiler must generate correct object code; an application is only as reliable as the compiler that compiled it.<br/>\r\n\r\nA compiler is itself a large and complex application that is worthy of study in its own right. This book tours most of the implementation of lcc, a compiler for the ANSI C programming language. It is to compiling what Software Tools by B.W. Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (Addison-Wesley, 1976) is to text processing like text editors and macro processors. Software design and implementation are best learned through experience with real tools. This book explains in detail and shows most of the code for a real compiler. The accompanying diskette holds the source code for the complete compiler.<br/>\r\n\r\nlcc is a production compiler. It's been used to compile production programs since 1988 and is now used by hundreds of C programmers daily. Detailing most of a production compiler in a book leaves little room for supporting material, so we present only the theory needed for the implementation at hand and leave the broad survey of compiling techniques to existing texts. The book omits a few language features--those with mundane or repetitive implementations and those deliberately treated only in the exercises--but the full compiler is available on the diskette, and the book makes it understandable.<br/>\r\n\r\nThe obvious use for this book is to learn more about compiler construction. But only few programmers need to know how to design and implement compilers. Most work on applications and other aspects of systems programming. There are four reasons why this majority of C programmers may benefit from this book.<br/>\r\n\r\nFirst, programmers who understand how a C compiler works are often better programmers in general and better C programmers in particular. The compiler writer must understand even the darkest corners of the C language; touring the implementation of those corners reveals much about the language itself and its efficient realization on modern computers.<br/>\r\n\r\nSecond, most texts on programming must necessarily use small examples, which often demonstrate techniques simply and elegantly. Most programmers, however, work on large programs that have evolved--or degenerated--over time. There are few well documented examples of this kind of \"programming in the large\" that can serve as reference examples. lcc isn't perfect, but this book documents both its good and bad points in detail and thus provides one such reference point.<br/>\r\n\r\nThird, a compiler is one of the best demonstrations in computer science of the interaction between theory and practice. lcc displays both the places where this interaction is smooth and the results are elegant, as well as where practical demands strain the theory, which shows in the resulting code. Exploring these interactions in a real program helps programmers understand when, where, and how to apply different techniques. lcc also illustrates numerous C programming techniques.<br/>\r\n\r\nFourth, this book is an example of a \"literate program.\" Like TEX: The Program by D.E. Knuth (Addison-Wesley, 1986), this book is lcc's source code and the prose that describes it. The code is presented in the order that best suits understanding, not in the order dictated by the C programming language. The source code that appears on the diskette is extracted automatically from the book's text files.<br/>\r\n\r\nThis book is well suited for self-study by both academics and professionals. The book and its diskette offer complete documented source code for lcc, so they may interest practitioners who wish to experiment with compilation or those working in application areas that use or implement language-based tools and techniques, such as user interfaces.<br/>\r\n\r\nThe book shows a large software system, warts and all. It could thus be the subject of a postmortem in a software engineering course, for example.<br/>\r\n\r\nFor compiler courses, this book complements traditional compiler texts. It shows one way of implementing a C compiler, while traditional texts survey algorithms for solving the broad range of problems encountered in compiling. Limited space prevents such texts from including more than a toy compiler. Code generation is often treated at a particularly high level to avoid tying the book to a specific computer.<br/>\r\n\r\nAs a result many instructors prepare a substantial programming project to give their students some practical experience. These instructors usually must write these compilers from scratch; students duplicate large portions and have to use the rest with only limited documentation. The situation is trying for both students and instructors, and unsatisfying to boot, because the compilers are still toys. By documenting most of a real compiler and providing the source code, this book offers an alternative.<br/>\r\n\r\nThis book presents full code generators for the MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Intel 386 and successor architectures. It exploits recent research that produces code generators from compact specifications. These methods allow us to present complete code generators for several machines, which no other book does. Presenting several code generators avoids tying the book to a single machine, and helps students appreciate engineering retargetable software.<br/>\r\n\r\nAssignments can add language features, optimizations, and targets. When used with a traditional survey text, assignments could also replace existing modules with those using alternate algorithms. Such assignments come closer to the actual practice of compiler engineering than assignments that implement most of a toy compiler, where too much time goes to low-level infrastructure and accommodating repetitive language features. Many of the exercises pose just these kinds of engineering problems.<br/>\r\n\r\nlcc has also been adapted for purposes other than conventional compilation. For example, it's been used for building a C browser and for generating remote-procedure-call stubs from declarations. It could also be used to experiment with language extensions, proposed computer architectures and code-generator technologies.<br/>\r\n\r\nWe assume readers are fluent in C and assembly language for some computer, know what a compiler is and have a general understanding of what one does, and have a working understanding of data structures and algorithms at the level covered in typical undergraduate courses; the material covered by Algorithms in C by R. Sedgewick (Addison-Wesley, 1990), for example, is more than sufficient for understanding lcc.</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "163", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/bMqNbS"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "170", QuestionID: "4", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "170", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "3" }, { ID: "170", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "3" }, { ID: "170", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "3" }, { ID: "170", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "3"}]}] }, { ID: "99", Title: "Engineering a Compiler", PublicationYear: "1995", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_99_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_99_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>Distils and illustrates principles and best practices for designing modern compilers</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "164", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/de6xcT"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "171", QuestionID: "4", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "171", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "3" }, { ID: "171", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "3" }, { ID: "171", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "3" }, { ID: "171", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "3"}]}] }, { ID: "100", Title: "Advanced Compiler Design & Implementation", PublicationYear: "2003", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_100_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_100_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>International edition, printed in India. 856 pages.

Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on * testing, debugging, and timing * set representations * string problems All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What remains the same in this new edition is Bentley's focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems.

It’s even smaller than you think.” </p>\r\n \r\n<p>These are players that strike a genuine chord with even the most jaded consumers.

There's simply no time for you to make any offer besides the one offer that will work and work quickly—The Irresistible Offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what is The Irresistible Offer? Simply put, it's the best (and maybe only) true alternative to the traditional form of selling with its sentimental manipulation, marketing trickery, and decreasing effectiveness. The Irresistible Offer is so good and so easy to understand that buying from you becomes a no-brainer for your customers. But it's not a one-time special or a \"unique selling proposition.\" The Irresistible Offer is the offer that defines your business and becomes your raison d'?tre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want an example? Domino's Pizza grew from a single store to a $4 billion chain in large part because they gave their customers an offer they couldn't refuse—\"thirty minutes or less\" or the pizza was free. The success of that offer is obvious in retrospect. But how do you design The Irresistible Offer for your own business in your own industry? This book shows you how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In The Irresistible Offer, author and New Marketing guru Mark Joyner defines and explains this revolutionary selling philosophy, uses real case studies to show it in effect, and helps you quickly and easily apply it to your own business. He examines the elements that make up The Irresistible Offer and presents a formula for creating one of your own. Plus, Joyner provides practical tools that allow you to estimate the effectiveness of your offer in advance so you can plan accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For too long, selling has been about manipulating a message and manipulating a consumer. The Irresistible Offer presents a new, effective, and ethical way to sell based on what you're selling, not how you're selling it. Rather than manipulate your customer (who may resent it, after all), Joyner shows you how to manipulate your offer instead—so that customers find it, and your company, truly irresistible.</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "85", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/axanOg" }, { ID: "100", Format: "E-Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/9miG60"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "111", QuestionID: "1", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "111", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "111", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "6" }, { ID: "111", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "111", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "6"}] }, { ID: "112", QuestionID: "2", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "112", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "112", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "112", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "112", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "6"}]}] }, { ID: "58", Title: "Ready, Fire, Aim: Zero to $100 Million in No Time Flat", PublicationYear: "2008", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_58_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_58_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>If you had the opportunity to work where, when, and with whom you wanted—all while getting paid very well—would you take it?

This pattern, says Moore, is unique to the high-tech industry.</p>\r\n<p>Moore suggests remedies for the problem that can help businesses meet their long-term goals. He coaches marketing professionals on how to move slowly through the gulf, teaching them to create profiles and target specific segments of the population rather than trying to plow right into the mainstream. He cites examples of successful chasm crossings by such companies as Apple, Tandem, Oracle, and Sun, showing what they all had in common and exposing the different weaknesses in their strategies. Moore also assigns responsibility for success to programmers and developers by suggesting they design a "whole product model." Here, because integration tasks are daunting to the mainstream market, all the components of a technological product must be in one package.

Gladwell\'s thesis that ideas, products, messages and behaviors "spread just like viruses do" remains a metaphor as he follows the growth of "word-of-mouth epidemics" triggered with the help of three pivotal types. These are Connectors, sociable personalities who bring people together; Mavens, who like to pass along knowledge; and Salesmen, adept at persuading the unenlightened. (Paul Revere, for example, was a Maven and a Connector). Gladwell\'s applications of his "tipping point" concept to current phenomena--such as the drop in violent crime in New York, the rebirth of Hush Puppies suede shoes as a suburban mall favorite, teenage suicide patterns and the efficiency of small work units--may arouse controversy.

Cusumano first identifies the key distinction between software and other businesses. In fact, he believes it is unlike every other business because software doesn't have one purpose but becomes whatever function it is handling for a particular customer or company. As a result, software companies must sell both products and services, according to the author. The two typical ways software companies operate is by getting the lion's share of revenues from new product sales or via IT consulting. The third way is what the author calls \"hybrid solutions companies—software firms that have some new product sales, but derive as much as 80% of their revenues from services and \"maintenance.\" However, what's essential for company success in today's rapidly changing technological marketplace is having sufficient flexibility to change to meet customer needs. Citing both real companies including IBM, Netscape, etc., along with academic studies, Cusumano describes the changing face of the software industry over the past two decades. The writing is coherent and, given the somewhat technical subject matter, surprisingly graspable even for technophobes. Still, this is a niche book, apt to appeal to people involved in the world of software, rather than a general business audience.</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "92", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/9xVmXJ" }, { ID: "110", Format: "E-Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/9Pcmyo"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "121", QuestionID: "2", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "121", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "121", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "4" }, { ID: "121", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "3" }, { ID: "121", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "3"}] }, { ID: "122", QuestionID: "7", ExperienceLevels: []}] }, { ID: "112", Title: "The Knack: How Street-Smart Entrepreneurs Learn to Handle Whatever Comes Up", PublicationYear: "2008", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_112_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_112_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>Brodsky and Burlingham, both Inc. magazine columnists, offer a host of advice to budding businesspeople in this thoughtful guide.

Unlike "red oceans," which are well explored and crowded with competitors, "blue oceans" represent "untapped market space" and the "opportunity for highly profitable growth." The only reason more big companies don\'t set sail for them, they suggest, is that "the dominant focus of strategy work over the past twenty-five years has been on competition-based red ocean strategies"-i.e., finding new ways to cut costs and grow revenue by taking away market share from the competition. With this groundbreaking book, Kim and Mauborgne-both professors at France\'s INSEAD, the second largest business school in the world-aim to repair that bias. Using dozens of examples-from Southwest Airlines and the Cirque du Soleil to Curves and Starbucks-they present the tools and frameworks they\'ve developed specifically for the task of analyzing blue oceans. They urge companies to "value innovation" that focuses on "utility, price, and cost positions," to "create and capture new demand" and to "focus on the big picture, not the numbers." And while their heavyweight analytical tools may be of real use only to serious strategy planners, their overall vision will inspire entrepreneurs of all stripes, and most of their ideas are presented in a direct, jargon-free manner. Theirs is not the typical business management book\'s vague call to action; it is a precise, actionable plan for changing the way companies do business with one resounding piece of advice: swim for open waters. </p>', VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "178", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/bg2lmf" }, { ID: "196", Format: "E-Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/aYrHYN" }, { ID: "197", Format: "AudioBook", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/clY7Zr"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "188", QuestionID: "2", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "188", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "188", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "4" }, { ID: "188", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "4" }, { ID: "188", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "3"}] }, { ID: "189", QuestionID: "5", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "189", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "7" }, { ID: "189", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "7" }, { ID: "189", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "189", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "5"}]}] }, { ID: "114", Title: "The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master", PublicationYear: "1999", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_114_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_114_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>Programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools (editors, object managers, version trackers) to generate a certain kind of product (programs) that will operate in some environment (operating systems on hardware assemblies). Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they've discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.\r\nSome of the authors' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, \"if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras.\" That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You'll want a copy of The Pragmatic Programmer for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered.

Excerpt: The ACM Computing Classification System is a subject classification system for computer science devised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The system is comparable to the Mathematics Subject Classification in scope, aims and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area. The system has gone through six revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, and the now current version in 1998. The ACM Computing Classification System is hierarchically structured in four levels: three outer levels, coded by capital letters and numbers, and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains I. Computing Methodologies, which contains:I.2 Artificial Intelligence, which contains:I.2.4 Knowledge representation formalisms and methods, which contains:Temporal logic.Each top-level category has two standard subcategories: "general", coded with a "0", and "miscellaneous", coded with a "m". For instance, I.0 denotes the "general" subcategory of Computing Methodologies, while I.m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory. Several subtopics are listed as uncoded subject descriptors in these standard subcategories</p>', VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "207", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/b8LTDx"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "202", QuestionID: "12", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "202", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "5" }, { ID: "202", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "5" }, { ID: "202", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "5" }, { ID: "202", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "5"}]}] }, { ID: "126", Title: "Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering", PublicationYear: "2003", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_126_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_126_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>This--this being the attitude encapsulated in Andrew \"bunnie\" Huang's Hacking the Xbox--is why a lot of people got into the computer industry in the first place.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple-seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.</p>', VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "213", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/9cqebU" }, { ID: "231", Format: "E-Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/bPal0O"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "209", QuestionID: "7", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "209", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "7" }, { ID: "209", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "7" }, { ID: "209", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "7" }, { ID: "209", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "7"}] }, { ID: "210", QuestionID: "11", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "210", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "8" }, { ID: "210", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "7" }, { ID: "210", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "210", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "5"}]}] }, { ID: "132", Title: "Head First Design Patterns", PublicationYear: "2004", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_132_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_132_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>You're not alone.</p>\r\n<p>At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on... something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look \"in the wild\". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design paddle pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, you want to learn the \"secret language\" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Head First Design Patterns, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the \"Trading Spaces\" show.

Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is still something of a marvel. Besides being a profound and entertaining meditation on human thought and creativity, this book looks at the surprising points of contact between the music of Bach, the artwork of Escher, and the mathematics of Gödel. It also looks at the prospects for computers and artificial intelligence (AI) for mimicking human thought. For the general reader and the computer techie alike, this book still sets a standard for thinking about the future of computers and their relation to the way we think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hofstadter's great achievement in Gödel, Escher, Bach was making abstruse mathematical topics (like undecidability, recursion, and 'strange loops') accessible and remarkably entertaining. Borrowing a page from Lewis Carroll (who might well have been a fan of this book), each chapter presents dialogue between the Tortoise and Achilles, as well as other characters who dramatize concepts discussed later in more detail. Allusions to Bach's music (centering on his Musical Offering) and Escher's continually paradoxical artwork are plentiful here. This more approachable material lets the author delve into serious number theory (concentrating on the ramifications of Gödel's Theorem of Incompleteness) while stopping along the way to ponder the work of a host of other mathematicians, artists, and thinkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world has moved on since 1979, of course. The book predicted that computers probably won't ever beat humans in chess, though Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997. And the vinyl record, which serves for some of Hofstadter's best analogies, is now left to collectors. Sections on recursion and the graphs of certain functions from physics look tantalizing, like the fractals of recent chaos theory. And AI has moved on, of course, with mixed results. Yet Gödel, Escher, Bach remains a remarkable achievement.

It's a carefully written, carefully researched gem that will appeal to anyone who wants to understand computer technology at its essence. Readers learn about number systems (decimal, octal, binary, and all that) through Petzold's patient (and frequently entertaining) prose and then discover the logical systems that are used to process them. There's loads of historical information too. From Louis Braille's development of his eponymous raised-dot code to Intel Corporation's release of its early microprocessors, Petzold presents stories of people trying to communicate with (and by means of) mechanical and electrical devices. It's a fascinating progression of technologies, and Petzold presents a clear statement of how they fit together.\r\nThe real value of Code is in its explanation of technologies that have been obscured for years behind fancy user interfaces and programming environments, which, in the name of rapid application development, insulate the programmer from the machine. In a section on machine language, Petzold dissects the instruction sets of the genre-defining Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 processors. He walks the reader through the process of performing various operations with each chip, explaining which opcodes poke which values into which registers along the way. Petzold knows that the hidden language of computers exhibits real beauty. In Code, he helps readers appreciate it.</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "216", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/aSbzgE"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "215", QuestionID: "6", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "215", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "6" }, { ID: "215", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "7" }, { ID: "215", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "7" }, { ID: "215", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "8"}] }, { ID: "216", QuestionID: "7", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "216", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "3" }, { ID: "216", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "4" }, { ID: "216", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "5" }, { ID: "216", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "6"}]}] }, { ID: "135", Title: "Working Effectively with Legacy Code", PublicationYear: "2004", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_135_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_135_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>Get more out of your legacy systems: more performance, functionality, reliability, and manageability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your code easy to change?

Cooper argues that technology (videocassette recorders, car alarms, most software applications for personal computers) consists largely of dancing bears--pieces that work, but not at all well. He goes on to say that this is more often than not the fault of poorly designed user interfaces, and he makes a good argument that way too many devices (perhaps as a result of the designers' subconscious wish to bully the people who tormented them as children) ask too much of their users.

Very little of it is in the form of code; most of the practical material takes the form of case studies and discussions of aspects of Unix, all aimed at determining why particular design characteristics are good.

In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project.

When you\'ve read his no-nonsense account of how he invented the World Wide Web, you\'ll want to thank him again, for the sheer coolness of his ideas. One day in 1980, Berners-Lee, an Oxford-trained computer consultant, got a random thought: "Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked?" So he created a system to give every "page" on a computer a standard address (now called a URL, or Universal Resource Locator), accessible via the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), formatted with the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and visible with the first browser, which did the trick of linking us all up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He may be the most self-effacing genius of the computer age, and his egalitarian mind is evident in the names he rejected for his invention: "I thought of Mine of Information, or MOI, but moi in French means \'me,\' and that was too egocentric.... The Information Mine (TIM) was even more egocentric!" Also, a mine is a passive repository; the Web is something that grows inexorably from everyone\'s contributions. Berners-Lee fully credits the colorful characters who helped him get the bobsled of progress going--one colleague times his haircuts to match the solstices--but he\'s stubbornly independent-minded. His quest is to make the Web "a place where the whim of a human being and the reasoning of a machine coexist in an ideal, powerful mixture."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard-core tech types may wish Berners-Lee had gone into deeper detail about the road ahead: the "boon and threat" of XML, free vs. commercial software, VRML 3-D imaging, and such.

The book then teaches you about the clues that indicate other people's personality type, including speaking style, body language, and occupation. You test yourself by reading a few scenarios and personality typing the characters described. You put the system to work by learning approaches to \"speedreading\" people in person and on the phone using skill-building exercises. Finally, you learn how to communicate effectively with people who are a different type or temperament than you. The Art of Speedreading People is intriguing and useful, especially for those who work in a sales, service, teaching, or managerial position, or any job where effective and positive communication is paramount.</p>", VoteCount: "1", wPurchaseInfo: [{ ID: "46", Format: "Book", PurchaseLink: "http://amzn.to/dnbplN"}], HNDiscussionLinks: [], QuestionsAnswered: [{ ID: "81", QuestionID: "14", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "81", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "7" }, { ID: "81", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "6" }, { ID: "81", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "81", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "6"}] }, { ID: "82", QuestionID: "2", ExperienceLevels: [{ ID: "82", ExperienceLevelID: "1", Score: "7" }, { ID: "82", ExperienceLevelID: "2", Score: "6" }, { ID: "82", ExperienceLevelID: "3", Score: "6" }, { ID: "82", ExperienceLevelID: "4", Score: "6"}]}] }, { ID: "37", Title: "The Rails Way", PublicationYear: "2010", SmallPictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_37_small.png", LargePictureLink: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hnb/book_37_large.png", HtmlDescription: "<p>Ruby on Rails strips complexity from the development process, enabling professional developers to focus on what matters most: delivering business value via clean and maintainable code.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Syntax</li>\r\n<li>Objects</li>\r\n<li>Functions</li>\r\n<li>Inheritance</li>\r\n<li>Arrays</li>\r\n<li>Regular expressions</li>\r\n<li>Methods</li>\r\n<li>Style</li>\r\n<li>Beautiful features</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

But as opportunities for innovation and growth migrate to the peripheries of companies, industries, and the global economy, efficiency will no longer be enough to sustain competitive advantage.<br />In Your Next Business Strategy, renowned business thinkers John Hagel and John Seely Brown argue that the only sustainable advantage in the future will come from an institutional capacity to work closely with other highly specialized firms to get better faster. Enabled by the emergence of global process networks, firms will undergo a three-stage transformation: deepening specialization within firms; mobilizing best-in-class capabilities across enterprises; and, ultimately, accelerating learning across broad networks of enterprises.<br /><br />Hagel and Seely Brown discuss the strategic levers that will accelerate this migration, and they outline a new approach to strategy development that will help companies capture this shifting source of strategic advantage.<br /><br />Calling for a forceful reinvention of business strategy and the very nature of the firm itself, this bold and forward-looking book reveals what every company must do today to become tomorrow’s market leader.<br /></p></div> <h1 id='4'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Insanely Great</a></h1><div><p>Back in the early 1980s, word spread about an inviting little personal computer that used something called a mouse and smiled at you when you turned it on.

Though Dennis, a poet (When Jack Sued Jill: Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times) and the founder of a publishing empire (including Maxim magazine), wants to help the reader rank at least among the lesser rich (equal to a net worth of $30 million–$80 million by his definition), he isn't himself motivated by money. With his own fortune estimated at between $400 million and $900 million, he doesn't have to be. Instead, Dennis wants to demystify the money-getting process, and his straight-talking, honest advice makes a refreshing change in this oversaturated field. Using humorous examples from his own business life, Dennis's advice, from The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors to The Power of Focus, might sound like conventional fare, but delivered in his signature bawdy, British style, it's altogether more entertaining—and more practical. Dennis highlights the right strategies and mindset to get readers their millions, but he won't air-brush his story or soften the bitter truth along the way. As he says, when it comes to acquiring wealth, being a bit of a shit helps.</p></div> <h1 id='6'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Word of Mouth Marketing</a></h1><div><p>Who Is Talking About You?<br />Foreword by Seth Godin and Afterword by Guy Kawasaki.<br />Master the art of word of mouth marketing with this practical hands-on guide.<br />With straightforward advice and humor, marketing expert Andy Sernovitz will show you how the world's most respected and profitable companies get their best customers for free through the power of word of mouth.<br />Learn the five essential steps that make word of mouth work and everything you need to get started using them.

Drawing extensively on psychosocial studies on memory, emotion and motivation, their study is couched in terms of "stickiness"—that is, the art of making ideas unforgettable. They start by relating the gruesome urban legend about a man who succumbs to a barroom flirtation only to wake up in a tub of ice, victim of an organ-harvesting ring. What makes such stories memorable and ensures their spread around the globe? The authors credit six key principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. (The initial letters spell out "success"—well, almost.) They illustrate these principles with a host of stories, some familiar (Kennedy's stirring call to "land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth" within a decade) and others very funny (Nora Ephron's anecdote of how her high school journalism teacher used a simple, embarrassing trick to teach her how not to "bury the lead"). Throughout the book, sidebars show how bland messages can be made intriguing. Fun to read and solidly researched, this book deserves a wide readership.</p></div> <h1 id='8'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails</a></h1><div><ul>

But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages.</p>

<p>This book puts the "Web" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book:</p>

<ul>Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language
<li>Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services</li>
<li>Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</li>
<li>Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol</li>
<li>Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages</li>
<li>Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python)</li>
<li>Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients</li>
<li>This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.</li>

When the pressure is on to root out an elusive software or hardware glitch, what's needed is a cool head courtesy of a set of rules guaranteed to work on any system, in any circumstance. Written in a frank but engaging style, Debugging provides simple, foolproof principles guaranteed to help find any bug quickly. This book makes those shelves of application-specific debugging books (on C++, Perl, Java, etc.) obsolete. It changes the way readers think about debugging, making those pesky problems suddenly much easier to find and fix. Illustrating the rules with real-life bug-detection war stories, the book shows readers how to: * Understand the system: how perceiving the ""roadmap"" can hasten your journey * Quit thinking and look: when hands-on investigation can't be avoided * Isolate critical factors: why changing one element at a time can be an essential tool * Keep an audit trail: how keeping a record of the debugging process can win the day"</div> <h1 id='12'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>C Interfaces and Implementations: Techniques for Creating Reusable Software</a></h1><div><p>Creating reusable software modules; they are the building blocks of large, reliable applications. Unlike some modern object-oriented languages, C provides little linguistic support or motivation for creating reusable application programming interfaces (APIs). While most C programmers use APIs and the libraries that implement them in almost every application they write, relatively few programmers create and disseminate new, widely applicable APIs. C Interfaces and Implementations shows how to create reusable APIs using interface-based design, a language-independent methodology that separates interfaces from their implementations. This methodology is explained by example. The author describes in detail 24 interfaces and their implementations, providing the reader with a thorough understanding of this design approach.</p>
<p>Features of C Interfaces and Implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concise interface descriptions that comprise a reference manual for programmers interested in using the interfaces.</li>

They can draw up business plans, have meetings with venture capitalists, maybe even get funded and actually launch a start-up. However, in The Monk and the Riddle, Silicon Valley sage Randy Komisar reasons that's only half the equation for success. And it may not be the important half. Komisar has worked with a number of companies--Apple, LucasArts Entertainment (the gaming division of George Lucas's empire), and WebTV among them--and has come to a rather startling conclusion: if you can't see yourself doing this business for the rest of your life, don't start it. In other words, he wants to see passion and purpose in business, not just spreadsheets and a by-the-numbers business model.</p>
<p>To illustrate, Komisar takes the reader through a hypothetical Silicon Valley start-up, with an eager entrepreneur named Lenny trying to get funding for an online casket-selling business. As Komisar helps Lenny find the real purpose of the business, the passion behind the revenue projections, he reflects back on his life as an entrepreneur. Komisar emerges as a master storyteller, the kind of guy you'd feel honored to share a bottle of wine with. And you believe his conclusion: "When all is said and done, the journey is the reward."

The premise behind this book is that in order for marketing strategies to work, they must be in tune with some quintessential force in the marketplace. Just as the laws of physics define the workings of the universe, so do successful marketing programs conform to the "22 Laws." Each law is presented with illustrations of how it works based on actual companies and their marketing strategies. For example, the "Law of Focus" states that the most powerful concept in marketing is "owning" a word in the prospect's mind, such as Crest's owning cavities and Nordstrom's owning service.

No matter: Clark is as successful and interesting an example of Homo siliconus as any writer is likely to find. Lewis (Liar's Poker) has created an absorbing and extremely literate profile of one of America's most successful entrepreneurs. Clark has created three companiesASilicon Graphics, Netscape (now part of America Online) and HealtheonAeach valued at more than $1 billion by Wall Street. Lewis was apparently given unlimited access to Clark, a man motivated in equal parts by a love of the technology he helps to create and a desire to prove something to a long list of people whom he believes have done him wrong throughout his life (especially his former colleagues at Silicon Graphics). As Lewis looks at the various roles of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and programmers and at how these very different mindsets fit together in the anatomy of big deals, he gives readers a sense of how the Valley works. But the heart of the book remains Clark, who simultaneously does everything from supervise the creation of what may be the world's largest sloop to creating his fourth company (currently in the works). Lewis does a good job of putting Clark's accomplishments in context, and if he is too respectful of Clark's privacy (several marriages and children are mentioned but not elaborated on), he provides a detailed look at the professional life of one of the men who have changed the world as we know it.</p></div> <h1 id='26'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Bulletproof Web Design: Improving flexibility and protecting against worst-case scenarios with XHTML and CSS (2nd Edition)</a></h1><div><p>No matter how visually appealing or content-packed a Web site may be, if it's not adaptable to a variety of situations and reaching the widest possible audience, it isn't really succeeding. In Bulletproof Web Desing, author and Web designer extraordinaire, Dan Cederholm outlines standards-based strategies for building designs that provide flexibility, readability, and user control--key components of every sucessful site. Each chapter starts out with an example of an unbulletproof site one that employs a traditional HTML-based approach which Dan then deconstructs, pointing out its limitations. He then gives the site a make-over using XHTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), so you can see how to replace bloated code with lean markup and CSS for fast-loading sites that are accessible to all users.

It was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. How to Win Friends and Influence People is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to "the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people." He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and "arousing in the other person an eager want." You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, "let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers," and "talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person." Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. </p></div> <h1 id='67'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>eBoys: The First Inside Account of Venture Capitalists at Work</a></h1><div><p>If you want to understand the 1990s, you have to understand venture capitalists.

They're looking for the next Amazon.com, the next Yahoo!, the next eBay. Randall E. Stross, who teaches business history at San José State University, just happened to be there when a firm called Benchmark Capital discovered eBay. eBoys tells the story of how a group of not-quite-middle-aged men came to make an investment that returned a Silicon Valley record of 100,000 percent.</p>
<p>Stross is a gifted storyteller who weaves the personal histories of the Benchmark partners with stories of how the firm came to back such companies as Priceline.com and Webvan. We meet guys who weren't born to privilege, men who took unconventional routes into the venture capital business. Probably the most intriguing is Dave Beirne, a hyperaggressive executive recruiter who went into the business after realizing venture capitalists are the ones who really call the shots at high-tech start-ups. We also see the problems Silicon Valley guys have when they try to dot-com the bricks-and-mortar world. The short tale of an aborted partnership between Benchmark and Toys 'R' Us illustrates why the old economy is so mystified by the new.</p>

Porter's Competitive Strategy has transformed the theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world. Electrifying in its simplicity -- like all great breakthroughs -- Porter's analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus -- which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter's framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new discipline of competitor assessment.</p>

<p>More than a million managers in both large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter's ideas and applied them to assess industries, understand competitors,, and choose competitive positions. The ideas in the book address the underlying fundamentals of competition in a way that is independent of the specifics of the ways companies go about competing.</p>

Competitive Strategy has filled a void in management thinking. It provides an enduring foundation and grounding point on which all subsequent work can be built. By bringing a disciplined structure to the question of how firms achieve superior profitability, Porter's rich frameworks and deep insights comprise a sophisticated view of competition unsurpassed in the last quarter-century.</div> <h1 id='69'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Liar's Poker</a></h1><div><p>As described by Lewis, liar's poker is a game played in idle moments by workers on Wall Street, the objective of which is to reward trickery and deceit.

</ul></div> <h1 id='98'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation</a></h1><div><p>The compiler is the linchpin of the programmer's toolbox. Working programmers use compilers every day and count heavily on their correctness and reliability. A compiler must accept the standard definition of the programming language so that source code will be portable across platforms. A compiler must generate efficient object code. Perhaps more important, a compiler must generate correct object code; an application is only as reliable as the compiler that compiled it.<br/>

A compiler is itself a large and complex application that is worthy of study in its own right. This book tours most of the implementation of lcc, a compiler for the ANSI C programming language. It is to compiling what Software Tools by B.W. Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (Addison-Wesley, 1976) is to text processing like text editors and macro processors. Software design and implementation are best learned through experience with real tools. This book explains in detail and shows most of the code for a real compiler. The accompanying diskette holds the source code for the complete compiler.<br/>

lcc is a production compiler. It's been used to compile production programs since 1988 and is now used by hundreds of C programmers daily. Detailing most of a production compiler in a book leaves little room for supporting material, so we present only the theory needed for the implementation at hand and leave the broad survey of compiling techniques to existing texts. The book omits a few language features--those with mundane or repetitive implementations and those deliberately treated only in the exercises--but the full compiler is available on the diskette, and the book makes it understandable.<br/>

The obvious use for this book is to learn more about compiler construction. But only few programmers need to know how to design and implement compilers. Most work on applications and other aspects of systems programming. There are four reasons why this majority of C programmers may benefit from this book.<br/>

First, programmers who understand how a C compiler works are often better programmers in general and better C programmers in particular. The compiler writer must understand even the darkest corners of the C language; touring the implementation of those corners reveals much about the language itself and its efficient realization on modern computers.<br/>

Second, most texts on programming must necessarily use small examples, which often demonstrate techniques simply and elegantly. Most programmers, however, work on large programs that have evolved--or degenerated--over time. There are few well documented examples of this kind of "programming in the large" that can serve as reference examples. lcc isn't perfect, but this book documents both its good and bad points in detail and thus provides one such reference point.<br/>

Third, a compiler is one of the best demonstrations in computer science of the interaction between theory and practice. lcc displays both the places where this interaction is smooth and the results are elegant, as well as where practical demands strain the theory, which shows in the resulting code. Exploring these interactions in a real program helps programmers understand when, where, and how to apply different techniques. lcc also illustrates numerous C programming techniques.<br/>

Fourth, this book is an example of a "literate program." Like TEX: The Program by D.E. Knuth (Addison-Wesley, 1986), this book is lcc's source code and the prose that describes it. The code is presented in the order that best suits understanding, not in the order dictated by the C programming language. The source code that appears on the diskette is extracted automatically from the book's text files.<br/>

This book is well suited for self-study by both academics and professionals. The book and its diskette offer complete documented source code for lcc, so they may interest practitioners who wish to experiment with compilation or those working in application areas that use or implement language-based tools and techniques, such as user interfaces.<br/>

The book shows a large software system, warts and all. It could thus be the subject of a postmortem in a software engineering course, for example.<br/>

For compiler courses, this book complements traditional compiler texts. It shows one way of implementing a C compiler, while traditional texts survey algorithms for solving the broad range of problems encountered in compiling. Limited space prevents such texts from including more than a toy compiler. Code generation is often treated at a particularly high level to avoid tying the book to a specific computer.<br/>

As a result many instructors prepare a substantial programming project to give their students some practical experience. These instructors usually must write these compilers from scratch; students duplicate large portions and have to use the rest with only limited documentation. The situation is trying for both students and instructors, and unsatisfying to boot, because the compilers are still toys. By documenting most of a real compiler and providing the source code, this book offers an alternative.<br/>

This book presents full code generators for the MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Intel 386 and successor architectures. It exploits recent research that produces code generators from compact specifications. These methods allow us to present complete code generators for several machines, which no other book does. Presenting several code generators avoids tying the book to a single machine, and helps students appreciate engineering retargetable software.<br/>

Assignments can add language features, optimizations, and targets. When used with a traditional survey text, assignments could also replace existing modules with those using alternate algorithms. Such assignments come closer to the actual practice of compiler engineering than assignments that implement most of a toy compiler, where too much time goes to low-level infrastructure and accommodating repetitive language features. Many of the exercises pose just these kinds of engineering problems.<br/>

lcc has also been adapted for purposes other than conventional compilation. For example, it's been used for building a C browser and for generating remote-procedure-call stubs from declarations. It could also be used to experiment with language extensions, proposed computer architectures and code-generator technologies.<br/>

We assume readers are fluent in C and assembly language for some computer, know what a compiler is and have a general understanding of what one does, and have a working understanding of data structures and algorithms at the level covered in typical undergraduate courses; the material covered by Algorithms in C by R. Sedgewick (Addison-Wesley, 1990), for example, is more than sufficient for understanding lcc.</p></div> <h1 id='99'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Engineering a Compiler</a></h1><div><p>Distils and illustrates principles and best practices for designing modern compilers</p></div> <h1 id='100'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Advanced Compiler Design & Implementation</a></h1><div><p>International edition, printed in India. 856 pages.

With references to dozens of programming languages, from Ada to Turing and everything in between (including C, C++, Java, and Perl), this book is a truly in-depth guide to how code is compiled (or interpreted) and executed on computer hardware. Early chapters tend to be slightly more theoretical (with coverage of regular expressions and context-free grammars) and will be most valuable to the computer science student, but much of this book is accessible to anyone seeking to widen their knowledge (especially since recent standards surrounding XML make use of some of the same vocabulary presented here).<br/>

The book has a comprehensive discussion of compilation and linking, as well as how data types are implemented in memory. Sections on functional and logical programming (illustrated with Scheme and Prolog, which are often used in AI research) can expand your understanding of how programming languages work. Final sections on the advantages--and complexities--of concurrent processing, plus a nice treatment of code optimization techniques, round out the text here. Each chapter provides numerous exercises, so you can try out the ideas on your own.<br/>

Examples included. DLC: Java </p>
<ul>
<li>The book shows clearly how a simple compiler can be decomposed into a syntactic analyzer, a contextual analyzer, and a code generator, communicating via an abstract syntax tree</li>
<li>The book is accompanied by a complete working compiler and interpreter, provided via the Internet, and free of charge for educational use</li>
<li>The book contains numerous exercises, together with sample answers to selected exercises. It also contains a number of suggested projects, involving extensions to the accompanying compiler</li>
<li>All examples in the book are expressed in Java, and the compiler and interpreter are structured using object-oriented design patterns</li>
</ul></div> <h1 id='104'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Lisp in Small Pieces</a></h1><div><p>This is a comprehensive account of the semantics and the implementation of the whole Lisp family of languages, namely Lisp, Scheme and related dialects. It describes 11 interpreters and 2 compilers, including very recent techniques of interpretation and compilation. The book is in two parts. The first starts from a simple evaluation function and enriches it with multiple name spaces, continuations and side-effects with commented variants, while at the same time the language used to define these features is reduced to a simple lambda-calculus. Denotational semantics is then naturally introduced. The second part focuses more on implementation techniques and discusses precompilation for fast interpretation: threaded code or bytecode; compilation towards C. Some extensions are also described such as dynamic evaluation, reflection, macros and objects. This will become the new standard reference for people wanting to know more about the Lisp family of languages: how they work, how they are implemented, what their variants are and why such variants exist. The full code is supplied (and also available over the Net). A large bibliography is given as well as a considerable number of exercises. Thus it may also be used by students to accompany second courses on Lisp or Scheme.</p></div> <h1 id='105'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation (3rd Edition)</a></h1><div><p>This classic book on formal languages, automata theory, and computational complexity has been updated to present theoretical concepts in a concise and straightforward manner with the increase of hands-on, practical applications. This new edition comes with Gradiance, an online assessment tool developed for computer science.</p>
 
<p>Gradiance is the most advanced online assessment tool developed for the computer science discipline.  With its innovative underlying technology, Gradiance turns basic homework assignments and programming labs into an interactive learning experience for students.  By using a series of “root questions” and hints, it not only tests a student’s capability, but actually simulates a one-on-one teacher-student tutorial that allows for the student to more easily learn the material.  Through the programming labs, instructors are capable of testing, tracking, and honing their students’ skills, both in terms of syntax and semantics, with an unprecedented level of assessment never before offered.</p></div> <h1 id='106'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Parsing Techniques: A Practical Guide</a></h1><div><p>Parsing, also referred to as syntax analysis, has been and continues to be an essential part of computer science and linguistics. Today, parsing is also applied in other disciplines; some examples are document preparation and conversion, chemical formulae typesetting, and chromosome recognition.</p>

<p>In addition to the traditional parsing techniques, this second edition presents new developments and discoveries: generalized deterministic parsing, linear-time substring parsing, parallel parsing, parsing as intersection, non-canonical methods, non-Chomsky systems, and many more.</P

<p>Parsing techniques provide a solid basis for compiler construction and linguistics, and contribute to all existing software: they enable Web browsers to analyze HTML pages and PostScript printers to analyze PostScript, and some of the more advanced techniques are used in code generation in compilers and in data compression. Also their importance as general pattern recognizers is slowly being acknowledged.</p>

<p>To provide readers with low-threshold access to the full field of parsing techniques, this book uses a two-tiered structure. The basic ideas behind the existing parsing techniques are explained in an intuitive and narrative style, starting from the first principles of data structures and algorithms; this provides breadth and accessibility. The hundreds of realizations and improvements of these basic ideas are explained in an extensive annotated bibliography, in a much terser, yet still informal style; this provides depth.</p>

<p>The reader should have an understanding of algorithmic thinking, especially recursion; however, knowledge of any particular programming language is not required.</p></div> <h1 id='107'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Programming Pearls</a></h1><div><p>The first edition of Programming Pearls was one of the most influential books I read early in my career, and many of the insights I first encountered in that book stayed with me long after I read it. Jon has done a wonderful job of updating the material. I am very impressed at how fresh the new examples seem." -Steve McConnell
When programmers list their favorite books, Jon Bentley's collection of programming pearls is commonly included among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience.</p>

<p>In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on * testing, debugging, and timing * set representations * string problems All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web.</p>

<p>What remains the same in this new edition is Bentley's focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems. Whether you are new to Bentley's classic or are revisiting his work for some fresh insight, the book is sure to make your own list of favorites.</p></div> <h1 id='108'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a></h1><div><p>The essential book for anyone bringing a product to market, writing a business plan, marketing plan or sales plan.

Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods is one example. Richard Feynman’s “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!” is another.</p>
 
<p>Now comes Youngme Moon’s Different, a book for “people who don’t read business books.” Actually, it’s more like a personal conversation with a friend who has thought deeply about how the world works … and who gets you to see that world in a completely new light. </p>
 
<p>If there is one strain of conventional wisdom pervading every company in every industry, it’s the absolute importance of “competing like crazy.” Youngme Moon’s message is simply “Get off this treadmill that’s taking you nowhere. Going tit for tat and adding features, augmentations, and gimmicks to beat the competition has the perverse result of making you like everyone else.” Different provides a highly original perspective on what it means to offer something that is meaningfully different—different in a manner that is both fundamental and comprehensive. </p>
 
<p>Youngme Moon identifies the outliers, the mavericks, the iconoclasts—the players who have thoughtfully rejected orthodoxy in favor of an approach that is more adventurous. Some are even “hostile,” almost daring you to buy what they are selling. The MINI Cooper was launched with fearless abandon: “Worried that this car is too small? Look here. It’s even smaller than you think.” </p>
 
<p>These are players that strike a genuine chord with even the most jaded consumers. In fact, almost every success story of the past two decades has been an exception to the rule. Simply go to your computer and compare AOL and Yahoo! with Google. The former pile on feature upon feature to their home pages, while Google is like an austere boutique, dominating a category filled with “extras.”</p>
 
<p>Different shows how to succeed in a world where conformity reigns…but exceptions rule.</p></div> <h1 id='111'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Growing a Business</a></h1><div><p>Nearly everyone harbors a secret dream of starting or owning a business. In fact, 1,000,000 businesses start in the United States every year. Many of them fail, but enough succeed so that small businesses are now adding millions of jobs to the economy at the same time that the Fortune 500 companies are actually losing jobs.</p>

<p>Paul Hawken -- entrepreneur and best-selling author -- wrote Growing a Business for those who set out to make their dream a reality. He knows what he's talking about; he is his own best example of success. In the early 1970s, while he was still in his twenties, he founded Erewhon, the largest distributor of natural foods. More recently, he founded and still runs Smith & Hawken, the premier mail-order garden tool company. And he wrote a critically acclaimed book called The Next Economy about the future of the economy.</p>

<p>Using examples like Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream, and University National Bank of Palo Alto, California, Hawken shows that the successful business is an expression of an individual person. The most successful business, your idea for a business, will grow from something that is deep within you, something that can't be stolen by anyone because it is so uniquely yours that anyone else who tried to execute your idea would fail. He dispels the myth of the risk-taking entrepreneur. The purpose of business, he points out, is not to take risks but rather to get something done.</p></div> <h1 id='43'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Beginning Rails 3</a></h1><div><p>Beginning Rails 3 is the practical starting point for anyone wanting to learn how to build dynamic web applications using the latest release of the Rails framework for Ruby.

<p>That's all you've really got to make the sale.</p>

<p>With consumers bombarded with thousands of marketing messages a day, they have to make purchasing decisions quickly, which means you have to make the sale just as quickly. There's simply no time for you to make any offer besides the one offer that will work and work quickly—The Irresistible Offer.</p>

<p>But what is The Irresistible Offer? Simply put, it's the best (and maybe only) true alternative to the traditional form of selling with its sentimental manipulation, marketing trickery, and decreasing effectiveness. The Irresistible Offer is so good and so easy to understand that buying from you becomes a no-brainer for your customers. But it's not a one-time special or a "unique selling proposition." The Irresistible Offer is the offer that defines your business and becomes your raison d'?tre.</p>

<p>Want an example? Domino's Pizza grew from a single store to a $4 billion chain in large part because they gave their customers an offer they couldn't refuse—"thirty minutes or less" or the pizza was free. The success of that offer is obvious in retrospect. But how do you design The Irresistible Offer for your own business in your own industry? This book shows you how.</p>

<p>In The Irresistible Offer, author and New Marketing guru Mark Joyner defines and explains this revolutionary selling philosophy, uses real case studies to show it in effect, and helps you quickly and easily apply it to your own business. He examines the elements that make up The Irresistible Offer and presents a formula for creating one of your own. Plus, Joyner provides practical tools that allow you to estimate the effectiveness of your offer in advance so you can plan accordingly.</p>

<p>For too long, selling has been about manipulating a message and manipulating a consumer.

</ul></div> <h1 id='60'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Crossing the Chasm</a></h1><div><p>Author Geoffrey Moore makes the case that high-tech products require marketing strategies that differ from those in other industries. His chasm theory describes how high-tech products initially sell well, mainly to a technically literate customer base, but then hit a lull as marketing professionals try to cross the chasm to mainstream buyers. This pattern, says Moore, is unique to the high-tech industry.</p>
<p>Moore suggests remedies for the problem that can help businesses meet their long-term goals. He coaches marketing professionals on how to move slowly through the gulf, teaching them to create profiles and target specific segments of the population rather than trying to plow right into the mainstream. He cites examples of successful chasm crossings by such companies as Apple, Tandem, Oracle, and Sun, showing what they all had in common and exposing the different weaknesses in their strategies. Moore also assigns responsibility for success to programmers and developers by suggesting they design a "whole product model." Here, because integration tasks are daunting to the mainstream market, all the components of a technological product must be in one package. Moore also describes strategies for competing with rival companies and assessing the best distribution channels for penetrating the target market.</p>

<p>Written not just for marketing specialists but for all employees whose futures ride on the success of a technical product, Crossing the Chasm delivers crucial information in an engaging, readable tone. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</p></div> <h1 id='61'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a></h1><div><p>The premise of this facile piece of pop sociology has built-in appeal: little changes can have big effects; when small numbers of people start behaving differently, that behavior can ripple outward until a critical mass or "tipping point" is reached, changing the world. Gladwell's thesis that ideas, products, messages and behaviors "spread just like viruses do" remains a metaphor as he follows the growth of "word-of-mouth epidemics" triggered with the help of three pivotal types. These are Connectors, sociable personalities who bring people together; Mavens, who like to pass along knowledge; and Salesmen, adept at persuading the unenlightened. (Paul Revere, for example, was a Maven and a Connector). Gladwell's applications of his "tipping point" concept to current phenomena--such as the drop in violent crime in New York, the rebirth of Hush Puppies suede shoes as a suburban mall favorite, teenage suicide patterns and the efficiency of small work units--may arouse controversy. For example, many parents may be alarmed at his advice on drugs: since teenagers' experimentation with drugs, including cocaine, seldom leads to hardcore use, he contends, "We have to stop fighting this kind of experimentation. We have to accept it and even embrace it." While it offers a smorgasbord of intriguing snippets summarizing research on topics such as conversational patterns, infants' crib talk, judging other people's character, cheating habits in schoolchildren, memory sharing among families or couples, and the dehumanizing effects of prisons, this volume betrays its roots as a series of articles for the New Yorker, where Gladwell is a staff writer: his trendy material feels bloated and insubstantial in book form</p></div> <h1 id='62'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application</a></h1><div><p>Getting Real details the business, design, programming, and marketing principles of 37signals. The book is packed with keep-it-simple insights, contrarian points of view, and unconventional approaches to software design. This is not a technical book or a design tutorial, it's a book of ideas. Anyone working on a web app -- including entrepreneurs, designers, programmers, executives, or marketers -- will find value and inspiration in this book. 37signals used the Getting Real process to launch five successful web-based applications (Basecamp, Campfire, Backpack, Writeboard, Ta-da List), and Ruby on Rails, an open-source web application framework, in just two years with no outside funding, no debt, and only 7 people (distributed across 7 time zones). Over 500,000 people around the world use these applications to get things done. Now you can find out how they did it and how you can do it too. It's not as hard as you think if you Get Real.</p></div> <h1 id='63'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business</a></h1><div><p>What do the Honda Supercub, Intel's 8088 processor, and hydraulic excavators have in common? They are all examples of disruptive technologies that helped to redefine the competitive landscape of their respective markets. These products did not come about as the result of successful companies carrying out sound business practices in established markets. In The Innovator's Dilemma, author Clayton M. Christensen shows how these and other products cut into the low end of the marketplace and eventually evolved to displace high-end competitors and their reigning technologies.</p>
<p>At the heart of The Innovator's Dilemma is how a successful company with established products keeps from being pushed aside by newer, cheaper products that will, over time, get better and become a serious threat. Christensen writes that even the best-managed companies, in spite of their attention to customers and continual investment in new technology, are susceptible to failure no matter what the industry, be it hard drives or consumer retailing. Succinct and clearly written, The Innovator's Dilemma is an important book that belongs on every manager's bookshelf. Highly recommended.</p></div> <h1 id='64'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Business of Software: What Every Manager, Programmer, and Entrepreneur Must Know to Thrive and Survive in Good Times and Bad</a></h1><div><p>Cusumano, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management and coauthor of Microsoft Secrets, offers a comprehensive overview of the software business and how the right approach is key to the success of technology companies. Cusumano first identifies the key distinction between software and other businesses. In fact, he believes it is unlike every other business because software doesn't have one purpose but becomes whatever function it is handling for a particular customer or company. As a result, software companies must sell both products and services, according to the author. The two typical ways software companies operate is by getting the lion's share of revenues from new product sales or via IT consulting. The third way is what the author calls "hybrid solutions companies—software firms that have some new product sales, but derive as much as 80% of their revenues from services and "maintenance." However, what's essential for company success in today's rapidly changing technological marketplace is having sufficient flexibility to change to meet customer needs. Citing both real companies including IBM, Netscape, etc., along with academic studies, Cusumano describes the changing face of the software industry over the past two decades. The writing is coherent and, given the somewhat technical subject matter, surprisingly graspable even for technophobes. Still, this is a niche book, apt to appeal to people involved in the world of software, rather than a general business audience.</p></div> <h1 id='112'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Knack: How Street-Smart Entrepreneurs Learn to Handle Whatever Comes Up</a></h1><div><p>Brodsky and Burlingham, both Inc. magazine columnists, offer a host of advice to budding businesspeople in this thoughtful guide. Having seen businesses fail and succeed, the authors have served as mentors to a wide variety of self-starters and use their experiences as object lessons. The book focuses mainly on big-picture practicalities—the protection of startup capital and the necessity of focusing on high–profit-margin sales—but also expounds on overcoming the sales mindset in favor of the entrepreneurial mentality and facing mistakes with grace and an eye to learning. With a clear, conversational style, the authors give advice on raising capital, maintaining relationships with banks and lenders, customer relations, dealing with unexpected roadblocks and hiring good management. But in the end, they contend that entrepreneurship is not only a passion but a way to achieve a happier, richer, fuller life for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren—and with the right mental habits and skills, anyone can achieve entrepreneurial success. Encouraging, succinct and informative, this is an excellent guide for anyone looking to dive into a new business or expand an existing one.</p></div> <h1 id='113'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant</a></h1><div><p>Kim and Mauborgne's blue ocean metaphor elegantly summarizes their vision of the kind of expanding, competitor-free markets that innovative companies can navigate. Unlike "red oceans," which are well explored and crowded with competitors, "blue oceans" represent "untapped market space" and the "opportunity for highly profitable growth." The only reason more big companies don't set sail for them, they suggest, is that "the dominant focus of strategy work over the past twenty-five years has been on competition-based red ocean strategies"-i.e., finding new ways to cut costs and grow revenue by taking away market share from the competition. With this groundbreaking book, Kim and Mauborgne-both professors at France's INSEAD, the second largest business school in the world-aim to repair that bias. Using dozens of examples-from Southwest Airlines and the Cirque du Soleil to Curves and Starbucks-they present the tools and frameworks they've developed specifically for the task of analyzing blue oceans. They urge companies to "value innovation" that focuses on "utility, price, and cost positions," to "create and capture new demand" and to "focus on the big picture, not the numbers." And while their heavyweight analytical tools may be of real use only to serious strategy planners, their overall vision will inspire entrepreneurs of all stripes, and most of their ideas are presented in a direct, jargon-free manner. Theirs is not the typical business management book's vague call to action; it is a precise, actionable plan for changing the way companies do business with one resounding piece of advice: swim for open waters. </p></div> <h1 id='114'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a></h1><div><p>Programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools (editors, object managers, version trackers) to generate a certain kind of product (programs) that will operate in some environment (operating systems on hardware assemblies). Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they've discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.
Some of the authors' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, "if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras." That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You'll want a copy of The Pragmatic Programmer for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book.</p></div> <h1 id='115'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>TCP/IP Illustrated</a></h1><div><p>This specially priced boxed set contains Volumes 1-3 of the acclaimed TCP/IP Illustrated books by W.

Excerpt: The ACM Computing Classification System is a subject classification system for computer science devised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The system is comparable to the Mathematics Subject Classification in scope, aims and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area. The system has gone through six revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, and the now current version in 1998. The ACM Computing Classification System is hierarchically structured in four levels: three outer levels, coded by capital letters and numbers, and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains I. Computing Methodologies, which contains:I.2 Artificial Intelligence, which contains:I.2.4 Knowledge representation formalisms and methods, which contains:Temporal logic.Each top-level category has two standard subcategories: "general", coded with a "0", and "miscellaneous", coded with a "m". For instance, I.0 denotes the "general" subcategory of Computing Methodologies, while I.m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory.

<p>There's a wealth of information in these pages about how to disassemble and reverse-engineer electronics, and Huang is careful to show you what tools you need, and how to use them (don't worry if you don't know how to use a soldering iron--that's covered here). There also are step-by-step guides (complete with photos) to a couple of projects, and interviews with key figures in the Xbox-hacking community. </p>

<p>Topics covered: How to enjoy a Microsoft Xbox game console without the mindless tedium of playing video games. This book shows you how to open an Xbox, make modifications to it (from a cosmetic LED color change, to putting in a new power supply, to adding a USB connector), and make the changes needed to get Linux running on it. In the process, readers get an education in reverse engineering electronic circuits, as well as in basic electronic techniques (soldering, crimping, etc) and in the intellectual property law that governs hacker activity.</p></div> <h1 id='127'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Disassembling Code: IDA Pro and SoftICE</a></h1><div><p>This book describes how software code analysis tools such as IDA Pro are used to disassemble programs written in high-level languages and recognize different elements of disassembled code in order to debug applications in less time. Also described are the basics of Assembly language programming (MASM) and the system and format of commands for the Intel microprocessor. Aspects of disassembling, analyzing, and debugging software code are considered in detail, and an overview of contemporary disassemblers and debuggers used when analyzing executable code is provided. The basics of working with these tools and their operating principles are also included, and emphasis is placed on analyzing software code and identifying the main structure of those languages in which they were written.</p></div> <h1 id='128'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>BIOS Disassembly Ninjutsu Uncovered</a></h1><div><p>Explaining security vulnerabilities, possible exploitation scenarios, and prevention in a systematic manner, this guide to BIOS exploitation describes the reverse-engineering techniques used to gather information from BIOS and expansion ROMs. SMBIOS/DMI exploitation techniques—including BIOS rootkits and computer defense—and the exploitation of embedded x86 BIOS are also covered.</p></div> <h1 id='129'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense</a></h1><div><p>Symantec's chief antivirus researcher has written the definitive guide to contemporary virus threats, defense techniques, and analysis tools. Unlike most books on computer viruses, The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense is a reference written strictly for white hats: IT and security professionals responsible for protecting their organizations against malware. Peter Szor systematically covers everything you need to know, including virus behavior and classification, protection strategies, antivirus and worm-blocking techniques, and much more.</p>

<p>Szor presents the state-of-the-art in both malware and protection, providing the full technical detail that professionals need to handle increasingly complex attacks.

An intended side effect of his documentary efforts is a feeling for how network-connected computers should be configured for maximum resistance to attack. Cole, who works with the attack-monitoring SANS Institute as an instructor and security consultant, conveys to his readers specific knowledge of offensive and defensive weaponry as well as general familiarity with attack strategies and good security practices. Hackers Beware is a good primer and really earns its price by going into enough detail to enable readers to actually do something to make their resources safer. It also enables its readers to understand more specialized security texts, including Stephen Northcutt's fine Intrusion Signatures and Analysis.
Cole's didactic style is largely conversational, embracing the fact that most computer exploits can be conveyed as stories about what hackers want and the steps they take to achieve their goals. He punctuates his prose passages with line drawings that clarify what gets passed among the machines involved in an attack, and pauses frequently to show programs' user interfaces and passages from their logs. Cole explains all the jargon he uses--a characteristic that alone distinguishes this book from many of its competitors.</p>

<p>Topics covered: What motivates black-hat hackers, and the technical means they use to go about satisfying their ambitions. General attack strategies--spoofing, password cracking, social engineering, and buffer overflows, among others--are explained, and the tools used to carry them out are catalogued. The same goes for defensive tools and practices.</p></div> <h1 id='131'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a></h1><div><p>As the application of object technology-particularly the Java programming language-has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.<p>

<p>With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple-seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.</p>

<p>In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.</p></div> <h1 id='132'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Head First Design Patterns</a></h1><div><p>You're not alone.</p>
<p>At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on... something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.</p>

<p>You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look "in the wild". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.</p>

<p>You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design paddle pattern.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you want to learn the "secret language" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.</p>

<p>With Head First Design Patterns, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the "Trading Spaces" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.</p>

<p>If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect - a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.</p></div> <h1 id='133'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a></h1><div><p>Twenty years after it topped the bestseller charts, Douglas R. Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is still something of a marvel. Besides being a profound and entertaining meditation on human thought and creativity, this book looks at the surprising points of contact between the music of Bach, the artwork of Escher, and the mathematics of Gödel. It also looks at the prospects for computers and artificial intelligence (AI) for mimicking human thought. For the general reader and the computer techie alike, this book still sets a standard for thinking about the future of computers and their relation to the way we think.</p>

<p>Hofstadter's great achievement in Gödel, Escher, Bach was making abstruse mathematical topics (like undecidability, recursion, and 'strange loops') accessible and remarkably entertaining. Borrowing a page from Lewis Carroll (who might well have been a fan of this book), each chapter presents dialogue between the Tortoise and Achilles, as well as other characters who dramatize concepts discussed later in more detail. Allusions to Bach's music (centering on his Musical Offering) and Escher's continually paradoxical artwork are plentiful here. This more approachable material lets the author delve into serious number theory (concentrating on the ramifications of Gödel's Theorem of Incompleteness) while stopping along the way to ponder the work of a host of other mathematicians, artists, and thinkers.</p>

<p>The world has moved on since 1979, of course. The book predicted that computers probably won't ever beat humans in chess, though Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997. And the vinyl record, which serves for some of Hofstadter's best analogies, is now left to collectors. Sections on recursion and the graphs of certain functions from physics look tantalizing, like the fractals of recent chaos theory. And AI has moved on, of course, with mixed results. Yet Gödel, Escher, Bach remains a remarkable achievement. Its intellectual range and ability to let us visualize difficult mathematical concepts help make it one of this century's best for anyone who's interested in computers and their potential for real intelligence. </p>

<p>Topics Covered: J.S. Bach, M.C. Escher, Kurt Gödel: biographical information and work, artificial intelligence (AI) history and theories, strange loops and tangled hierarchies, formal and informal systems, number theory, form in mathematics, figure and ground, consistency, completeness, Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, recursive structures, theories of meaning, propositional calculus, typographical number theory, Zen and mathematics, levels of description and computers; theory of mind: neurons, minds and thoughts; undecidability; self-reference and self-representation; Turing test for machine intelligence.</p></div> <h1 id='134'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a></h1><div><p>Charles Petzold's latest book, Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, crosses over into general-interest nonfiction from his usual programming genre. It's a carefully written, carefully researched gem that will appeal to anyone who wants to understand computer technology at its essence. Readers learn about number systems (decimal, octal, binary, and all that) through Petzold's patient (and frequently entertaining) prose and then discover the logical systems that are used to process them. There's loads of historical information too. From Louis Braille's development of his eponymous raised-dot code to Intel Corporation's release of its early microprocessors, Petzold presents stories of people trying to communicate with (and by means of) mechanical and electrical devices. It's a fascinating progression of technologies, and Petzold presents a clear statement of how they fit together.
The real value of Code is in its explanation of technologies that have been obscured for years behind fancy user interfaces and programming environments, which, in the name of rapid application development, insulate the programmer from the machine. In a section on machine language, Petzold dissects the instruction sets of the genre-defining Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 processors. He walks the reader through the process of performing various operations with each chip, explaining which opcodes poke which values into which registers along the way. Petzold knows that the hidden language of computers exhibits real beauty. In Code, he helps readers appreciate it.</p></div> <h1 id='135'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></h1><div><p>Get more out of your legacy systems: more performance, functionality, reliability, and manageability</p>

Such bears, says author Alan Cooper, don't dance well, as everyone at the circus can see. What amazes the crowd is that the bear dances at all. Cooper argues that technology (videocassette recorders, car alarms, most software applications for personal computers) consists largely of dancing bears--pieces that work, but not at all well. He goes on to say that this is more often than not the fault of poorly designed user interfaces, and he makes a good argument that way too many devices (perhaps as a result of the designers' subconscious wish to bully the people who tormented them as children) ask too much of their users. Too many systems (like the famous unprogrammable VCR) make their users feel stupid when they can't get the job done.</P

<p>Cooper, who designed Visual Basic (the programming environment Microsoft promotes for the purpose of creating good user interfaces), indulges in too much name-dropping and self-congratulation (Cooper attributes the quote, "How did you do that?" to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, upon looking at one of Cooper's creations)--but this appears to be de rigueur in books about the software industry. But those asides are minor. More valuable is the discourse about software design and implementation ("[O]bject orientation divides the 1000-brick tower into 10 100-brick towers.").

But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>

<p>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.</p>

<p>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.</p>

<p>Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p>

Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned.</p>

<p>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform.</p>

<p>This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts.</p>

Eric S. Raymond argues in The Art of UNIX Programming that the excellence of Unix derives as much from the fact that it was (and continues to be) a community effort as from the fact that a lot of smart people have worked to design and build it. Raymond, best known as the author of the open-source manifesto The Cathedral and the Bazaar, says in his preface that this is a "why-to" book, rather than a "how-to" book. It aims to show new Unix programmers why they should work under the old "hacker ethic"--embracing the principles of good software design for its own sake and of code-sharing.</p>
<p>That said, a great deal of valuable practical information appears in this book. Very little of it is in the form of code; most of the practical material takes the form of case studies and discussions of aspects of Unix, all aimed at determining why particular design characteristics are good. In many cases, the people who did the work in the first place make guest appearances and explain their thinking--an invaluable resource.

Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process.</p>

<p>Domain-Driven Design fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development.</p>

<p>Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:</p>

<li>Getting all team members to speak the same language</li>
<li>Connecting model and implementation more deeply</li>
<li>Sharpening key distinctions in a model</li>

<li>Dealing with coexisting models on the same project</li>
<li>Organizing systems with large-scale structures</li>
<li>Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs</li>
<li>With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.</li>

</ul></div> <h1 id='153'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>SICP</a></h1><div><p>Abelson and Sussman's classic Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs teaches readers how to program by employing the tools of abstraction and modularity. The authors' central philosophy is that programming is the task of breaking large problems into small ones. The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together.</p>

<p>The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question "What is programming?" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of "What is data?" and "What is a procedure?"</p>

<p>The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book's concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming.</p></div> <h1 id='154'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a></h1><div><p>Tufte's masterful and dead-on takes about how to communicate statistical and quantitative data challenges standard assumptions about developing graphical information and reveals, though it is not his stated intention, the weakness of so many graphics software packages. Just look at his collection of chartjunk and "ducks" (his term for hideous graphics) to see how all the whistles and bells available to us via computer graphics programs actually obfuscate the interpretation of visual information. By the time you read how much ink and paper are wasted by created bad graphics, you should be a convert.</p></div> <h1 id='155'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles</a></h1><div><p>In the early days of computer science, the interactions of hardware, software, compilers, and operating system were simple enough to allow students to see an overall picture of how computers worked. With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system.</p>

<p>Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.</p>

<p>Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.</p>

<p>The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.</p></div> <h1 id='156'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>On LISP: Advanced Techniques for Common LISP</a></h1><div><p>Perhaps the author gives the best description of this book: "On Lisp deals mostly with the kinds of programs you could only write in Lisp." The book provides extensive information on the advanced features of Lisp, which are not found in other popular programming languages. After showing how flexibly functions can be manipulated, On Lisp moves on to the best discussion of macros available, which includes details of the possible pitfalls (various referential bugs, for example). The book concludes with a demonstration of various advanced constructs that can be implemented in Lisp using the tools developed in the earlier part of the book. As with his other book, ANSI Common Lisp, Graham writes in a fluid style that is a pleasure to read.</p></div> <h1 id='157'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Haskell School of Expression: Learning Functional Programming through Multimedia</a></h1><div><p>Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the use of functions (in contrast to object-oriented programming, which emphasizes the use of objects). It has become popular in recent years because of its simplicity, conciseness, and clarity. This book teaches functional programming as a way of thinking and problem solving, using Haskell, the most popular purely functional language. Rather than using the conventional (boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language textbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications, including graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader with working programs for inherently more interesting applications. Aimed at both beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle introduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced topics. Details about progamming in Haskell are presented in boxes throughout the text so they can be easily found and referred to.</p></div> <h1 id='158'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web</a></h1><div><p>If you can read this review (and voice your opinion about his book on Amazon.com), you have Tim Berners-Lee to thank. When you've read his no-nonsense account of how he invented the World Wide Web, you'll want to thank him again, for the sheer coolness of his ideas. One day in 1980, Berners-Lee, an Oxford-trained computer consultant, got a random thought: "Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked?" So he created a system to give every "page" on a computer a standard address (now called a URL, or Universal Resource Locator), accessible via the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), formatted with the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and visible with the first browser, which did the trick of linking us all up.</p>

<p>He may be the most self-effacing genius of the computer age, and his egalitarian mind is evident in the names he rejected for his invention: "I thought of Mine of Information, or MOI, but moi in French means 'me,' and that was too egocentric.... The Information Mine (TIM) was even more egocentric!" Also, a mine is a passive repository; the Web is something that grows inexorably from everyone's contributions. Berners-Lee fully credits the colorful characters who helped him get the bobsled of progress going--one colleague times his haircuts to match the solstices--but he's stubbornly independent-minded. His quest is to make the Web "a place where the whim of a human being and the reasoning of a machine coexist in an ideal, powerful mixture."</p>

<p>Hard-core tech types may wish Berners-Lee had gone into deeper detail about the road ahead: the "boon and threat" of XML, free vs. commercial software, VRML 3-D imaging, and such. But he wants everyone in on the debate, so he wrote a brisk book that virtually anyone can understand</p></div> <h1 id='159'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design</a></h1><div><p>When the first edition of About Face was published in 1995, the idea of designing products based on human goals was a revolutionary concept. Thanks to the work of Alan Cooper and other pioneers, interaction design is now widely recognized as a unique and vital discipline, but our work is far from finished.</p>

<p>This completely updated volume presents the effective and practical tools you need to design great desktop applications, Web 2.0 sites, and mobile devices. This book will teach you the principles of good product behavior and introduce you to Cooper's Goal-Directed Design method, from conducting user research to defining your product using personas and scenarios. In short, About Face 3 will show you how to design the best possible digital products and services.</p></div> <h1 id='160'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>Real World Haskell</a></h1><div><p>This easy-to-use, fast-moving tutorial introduces you to functional programming with Haskell.

Clearly organized and filled with a wide-ranging perspective on over 40 different languages, this book will be appreciated for its depth and breadth of coverage on an essential topic in computer science.</p>
<p>With references to dozens of programming languages, from Ada to Turing and everything in between (including C, C++, Java, and Perl), this book is a truly in-depth guide to how code is compiled (or interpreted) and executed on computer hardware. Early chapters tend to be slightly more theoretical (with coverage of regular expressions and context-free grammars) and will be most valuable to the computer science student, but much of this book is accessible to anyone seeking to widen their knowledge (especially since recent standards surrounding XML make use of some of the same vocabulary presented here).</p>

<p>The book has a comprehensive discussion of compilation and linking, as well as how data types are implemented in memory. Sections on functional and logical programming (illustrated with Scheme and Prolog, which are often used in AI research) can expand your understanding of how programming languages work. Final sections on the advantages--and complexities--of concurrent processing, plus a nice treatment of code optimization techniques, round out the text here. Each chapter provides numerous exercises, so you can try out the ideas on your own.</p>

<p>Students will benefit from the practical examples here, drawn from a wide range of languages. If you are a self-taught developer, the very approachable tutorial can give you perspective on the formal definitions of many computer languages, which can help you master new ones more effectively.</p></div> <h1 id='36'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Art of Speedreading People: Harness the Power of Personality Type and Create What You Want in Business and in Life</a></h1><div><p>Do you communicate ineffectively with some people and powerfully with others? The reason may be a difference in personalities and communication preferences. The Art of Speedreading People is a crash course in communication strategies, showing you how to observe behavioral clues to gain valuable insights into people's personalities and communication styles. The result: you become a more effective and convincing communicator, and you are more likely to receive the response you want.</p>
<p>This book is like a practical communications seminar based on the psychology model called Personality Typing, which is focused on identifying key personality traits in order to communicate most effectively. First, you analyze your own personality type and determine your placement on the scales of extrovert/introvert, sensor/intuitive, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. The book then teaches you about the clues that indicate other people's personality type, including speaking style, body language, and occupation. You test yourself by reading a few scenarios and personality typing the characters described. You put the system to work by learning approaches to "speedreading" people in person and on the phone using skill-building exercises. Finally, you learn how to communicate effectively with people who are a different type or temperament than you. The Art of Speedreading People is intriguing and useful, especially for those who work in a sales, service, teaching, or managerial position, or any job where effective and positive communication is paramount.</p></div> <h1 id='37'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Rails Way</a></h1><div><p>Ruby on Rails strips complexity from the development process, enabling professional developers to focus on what matters most: delivering business value via clean and maintainable code.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p>

<p>Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. </p>

<p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Regular expressions</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Style</li>
<li>Beautiful features</li>
</ul>
<p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. </p>

<p>With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.</p></div> <h1 id='42'> <a href='http://amzn.to/8XBV8v'>The Art of SEO: Mastering Search Engine Optimization (Theory in Practice)</a></h1><div><p>A well-designed, easy-to-navigate website is useless if no one can find it.

            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>A while back <a href="http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/10/top-dozen-hacke.php">I wrote an article on my blog</a>
             listing all the books that hackers recommended to each other from 
            the site <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news">HackerNews</a>. The purpose was to provide a place to list book recommendations so 
            that people didn't have to type in the same list over and over again. (HN gets several requests for 
            book recommendations a week. I also get at least a couple each month). <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1755422">It was very well received</a>, and 
            <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1758059"></a>many posters and commenters either asked that I make a site or sent me an email asking me to do so.</p> 
            <h3>How is this any different from the list on the blog?</h3>
            <p>This list has more books. This list is sortable both by what question you have and your skill level. 
            In addition, once you sort the list, <strong>you can save the link with your sort and send it to somebody else.</strong> So, for instance, 
            when somebody wants a book for noobs learning to program, you can make a link for that and then reuse it</p>
            <h3>How did you collect these books?</h3>
            <p>Initially the list came from Googling HackerNews.com "best book" and taking the books from the 
            first few pages returned. Later, I added all the books that were mentioned "You left that out!" when 
            Jacques posted the link. While adding <em>those </em>books, I came across a Stack Overflow link where programmers were 
            asked to list their favorite tech books, so I included those too.</p>
            <h3>If I ask you to put a book on here, will you?</h3>
            <p>It depends.</p>
            <p>These books were all gathered by finding places where hackers hang out and are suggesting books to other hackers and other hackers agree with them by voting up their suggestion. If 
            I can find an example of this for your book, I'm happy to include it.</p>
            <h3>How are the books ranked?</h3>
            <p>I did the best I could with ranking. I am sure there are many things you do not agree with. It would be 
            possible to add voting and personal ranking -- that would make the system much better. Heck, 
            you could rank the books yourself and use it as a customized book list to show to people who want your advice. I'd like to do that, 
            but if I've learned anything is to not let your featureset get ahead of the users. 
            This first version will test the waters to see what kind of interest the community might have.</p>
